It was explained to me as one big clover leaf, thats why I named it Clover Leaf, but it is anything but. It looks nothing like a clover leaf...ironic. I was told to always take the straight path and it will all connect back onto itself. At every intersection I did just that and I just kept riding and riding. It did double back over itself a few times but It seemed like an endless trail. It was my first time, it was raining and it was getting dark fast. We rode for just over an hour and never let up. the trail system is amazing and fast with an awesome flow. I imagine it is a local secret, so I apologize for letting the cat out of the bag, but this trail is too nice to be a secret. The Bike Beat is a local bike shop less than a mile from this trail and a must visit store, amazing service and a great staff. I am from out of town, they fixed my bike and showed me the way to this amazing trail. If the sun didn''t set, we would have ridden this trail for at least another hour or more. Very fast, the perfect ratio of climbs and descents, a few jumps and obsticles well placed along the trail. I think it eventually connects with a series of walking paths from some of the nearby housing areas because we came across some benches and ended up poking out of the woods at some houses before ducking back in. This will be on my list of trails to visit again when I return to the area. Very similar ride to New Quarter Park as far as the flow. Missed Freedom due to the rain, that is close by as well. So if you are like me, this trail can be ridden with a visit to an amazing shop for some rest and replenishment before heading down the road to hit another great trail.
