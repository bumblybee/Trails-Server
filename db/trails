Short, flat, easy trails are accessible right from the parking lot for beginner riders, but keep heading further in and you''ll experience intermediate singletrack as well as advanced trails full of rocks, jumps, berms, and some serious exposure. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />While Blankets is definitely busy and can get crowded sometimes, the reputation and the popularity has been well-earned.

I was told to always take the straight path and it will all connect back onto itself. At every intersection I did just that and I just kept riding and riding. It did double back over itself a few times but It seemed like an endless trail. It was my first time, it was raining and it was getting dark fast. We rode for just over an hour and never let up. the trail system is amazing and fast with an awesome flow. I imagine it is a local secret, so I apologize for letting the cat out of the bag, but this trail is too nice to be a secret. The Bike Beat is a local bike shop less than a mile from this trail and a must visit store, amazing service and a great staff. I am from out of town, they fixed my bike and showed me the way to this amazing trail. If the sun didn''t set, we would have ridden this trail for at least another hour or more. Very fast, the perfect ratio of climbs and descents, a few jumps and obsticles well placed along the trail. I think it eventually connects with a series of walking paths from some of the nearby housing areas because we came across some benches and ended up poking out of the woods at some houses before ducking back in. This will be on my list of trails to visit again when I return to the area. Very similar ride to New Quarter Park as far as the flow. Missed Freedom due to the rain, that is close by as well. So if you are like me, this trail can be ridden with a visit to an amazing shop for some rest and replenishment before heading down the road to hit another great trail. Probably can get more than 8 miles out of it, but that is how far we rode that night.","In the city of EWilliamsburg, VA. Near the intersection of Monticello Ave. and Ironbound Road.

It is mostly mellow forest riding, a few miles of road, a few miles of uphill climbing, and some fairly fast but unremarkable downhill.  Being in the Fraser area means that there is little true &quot;single track&quot; -- most of the trails are reclaimed forest roads that are being used as bike trails.  That means don''t count on much roller coaster fun riding.  It is pretty much all steady grade climbs and descents, mostly straight trail without a lot of thrills.  You can ride this loop clockwise or counterclockwise.  Clockwise will present Tipperary as a downhill, which is preferable to riding Spruce Creek down since Spruce Creek is basically a steady grade with lots of loose rock.  Tipperary, in my opinion, is the better ride down.  On the other hand, riding counterclockwise means you can ride down Flume, which is one of the funner rides in the area.  Don''t even try to do this ride without a good map or somebody who knows the way; there are too many trails and intersections that can lead you astray.  Note, if you are riding counterclockwise, when you get to the bottom of Flume, you will want to go across the creek (the fork to the left) and pick up the lower section of the Creekside trail to take you back to the road.  If you ride it clockwise you can ride up Creekside instead of Flume (they both parallel the creek) and not slowdown the downhill riders on Flume.","There are many places you can access this loop so feel free to pick up the trail wherever is most convenient for you.
