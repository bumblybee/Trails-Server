    "description": "Monagas Mountain Bike Trails are located at the municipality of Bayamon, which is inside Puerto Rico's metropolitan area. The trail network is inside the Julio E. Monagas National Park and is composed of around 15 trails that run throughout the park. They are properly identified with signs marking the entry and exit points, and direction arrows throughout the routes. They are identified at their entry points with difficulty level logos which makes it easier for newcomers to know which trail to tackle first. The park is located in which as an US Army location, so throughout the park one can see old bunkers and watch posts. The trails are composed of single-tracks with lots of roots present throughout the trails. There are some streams of water that needs to be crossed though the wooden bridges in place, and some natural \"staircases\" formed by the large roots, which combined with the uphill location of the roots and the narrow of the track throw the technical part to the mix. The list of trails currently active on the network are: -La Caverna -Mirador -El Lago -Cuesta Las Marias -Las Tablas -Magic Kingdom I -Magic Kingdom II -Los Columpios -La Ceiba -Los Picapiedras -Boys Scouts -Triple Cuesta -Blair Witch -Hobbits -Almendros As previously mentioned, the trails are located inside a forest park, so rain in the months of October to February is normal in the area which can render some of the trails unusable. But hey, it's the Caribbean! So a couple of continuous days of sun and all trails are back. For more information about this location you can call the Park offices at (787) 269-6600 &amp; (787) 269-6603.",

The Visitor Center displays artifacts from the ranching and farming history of the Hayward area. There is a blacksmith shop, a tool shop and several ranching-related displays to explore. An interesting collection of antique farm machinery outside the barn augments the display. Meyers Cottage was a popular summer home of Edith, Mildred, and Jeanette Meyers, three sisters of Alameda who were very involved in local charities and fundraisers during the early and mid 1900s. The sisters also owned the 1,200-acre Dry Creek Ranch, which was donated to the Park District in 1979 and later opened as Dry Creek Regional Park. Upon the passing of the last surviving Meyers sister, the Meyers Cottage and its garden was also donated to the Park District. The Park District plans to eventually open the cottage for receptions, weddings, and similar events, and it will also house a small visitor center.",

(take a right down the hill to get water at the well which will be on your left) 14) take a left on the main road and look for the 2nd trail entrance that does not say \"foot traffic only) 15) this will bring you up to the top of the ski mountain. ride up by the lifts but stay left. (don't ride down the mountain, or do, I haven't yet) 16) trail will be up on your left, go down the hill and take your first left back to the main road. 17) climb up the mountain on the road to the top (there is a technical way down from behind the towers up there but I haven't mapped it well yet) 18) ride back down the dirt road and head back down. 19) on the right keep an eye out for picnic tables, there is a small trail opening on the right, take that 20) take a right at the end and follow any path back down to Wadhams road. from there you can ride back to eli bunker direct or back down the way you came up. Hope we can find more trails in here. Looks promising. Not a much singletrack but very rideable and a good workout.

Section one begins at the top of the hill, includes 4 berms on a quick downhill switchback and exits on to the park service road. From there you ride up the service road about 50+ feet to the beginning of section 2, which heads off into the woods down to the left includes a benched downhill trail with 2 berms and a culvert crossing. This section exits into singletrack crossing a small grassy field. Travel straight into the field 100-150 ft and enter section 3 into the woods to the right.

    "description": "Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park is an expansive park system complete with reservoir, swimming areas... and a surprisingly good trail system. However, it does cost $10 to park in the park, but there is a Park and Ride lot located just outside the entrance near the off ramp for the 57 Freeway. You can easily park your car there and ride into the park, getting access to the trails for free! While at first the trails appeared to be just wide, gated gravel roads, as I continued around the park I started to find more and more singletrack. The trails were entertainingly rocky in places, and uber fast and smooth in others. Despite having a trail map, I had issues following the designated route in places. As I was nearing the end of the loop, I took a wrong turn and ended up on a different trail that took me out of the park. It conveniently led me very near to where I had parked at the park and ride, so in the end everything worked out! One word of caution: these trails are very exposed, and the majority of it has absolutely no shade or respite from the blazing sun. Ride early in the morning, or during times of the year when the temps are cooler.",

High Lonesome at 6 miles is a little short for me so I continue on to Caribou Trail and Strawberry West. Once you get to Strawberry West there is no easy way back I've ridden it as an out and back and as a loop. Pick your poison These are some nice technical trails with lots of natural features rocks, roots, stream crossings, bridges, logs, rocks and more rocks. Caribou Trail is like a 5 mile bushwhack! Strawberry West Trail is some sweet singletrack. This year they put in some new signs that helps. At least you know you're on the right track. Strawberry Creek Trail N9 1 from Caribou Trail to Strawberry West is more hike-a-bike to a phenomenal downhill run From Devils Thumb Trailhead follow Devils Thumb Trail a short distance to High Lonesome Trail. Follow High Lonesome Trail to The Junco Lake parking area 6mi. total. Head out of the parking lot to FS 129 turn right follow the road about Â½ way around Meadow Creek Reservoir turn right on FS 857.2 watch for Caribou Trail to take off on the right. The trail is blazed and still hard to follow but generally follows the creek. Left when you reach Strawberry West Trail ride up to FS 129 turn left to FS 128 right back to where you parked.

This write up covers the section of the trail which runs from Harford Road to Pleasantville Road and is approximately 10 miles out and back. From the parking lot on the Baltimore County (south) side of the Little Gunpowder, enter the trail. Trail head is right in the middle of the lot. Follow the trail along the Little Gunpowder. There are four stream crossings and some nice rock gardens along the trail to Bottom road. When the trail exits onto Bottom Road, go right across the bridge over the Little Gunpowder River. Continue on Bottom Road until you pass Laurel Brook Road on your right. Just past Laurel Brook Road, enter the trail again on the left. The entry is a nice steep uphill climb to a flat trail. This section of the trail is an old railroad bed, so it's pretty flat for about .75 miles. At several points you can see the Little Gunpowder on your left down in the valley. Continue on the old rail trail until it abruptly ends, then turn left. There is a nice little 2 ft. drop around the first turn. The trail continues towards Pleasantville Road, with a couple of nice uphill sections and some rooty, technical downhill sections. Once you've reached Pleasantville Road, take a left on Pleasantville and ride across the bridge over the Little Gunpowder. Be careful here! The cars headed northbound on Pleasantville have a sharp, almost blind turn to get onto the bridge. Just over the bridge, lift your bike over the guard rail and onto the trail again. You're now in the Balto county again. The first section of trail has a nice, technical downhill section to a small stream crossing. The trail on this side of the L'il Gunpowder has some swooping up and downhill sections with stream crossings at the terminus of each downhill. Some fun technical sections, too. Continue along this trail until it dumps you out onto Bottom Road again. Come out of the woods and go left on Bottom, back down towards the L'il Gunpowder. Enter the woods on the right before you cross the bridge and backtrack along the little Gunpowder towards Hardord Road. At two of the stream crossings on this leg there are side loops that follow the streams uphill, cross the stream, the follow it back downhill. One of them has a nice, small waterfall at the top. This is a multi-use trail, and during the summer sections of it can be overgrown. Sticker bushes, the unofficial MD state flower. ",

    "description": "This trail description is South-to-North. You will want a shuttle vehicle at the other trailhead off H75 Road. We used Peach Valley Road to drop the shuttle at that end. The Sidewinder Trail is a relentless, rocky, technical, physical adventure on the bike. There are very few extended climbs or downhills, but my GPS still measured 2500' of climbing and 3000' of total descending by the time we were done. Mostly it is a constant mind-game of rocky, technical bike-handling tests. There are very few sections of fast cruising. The trail is extremely well-built though so the technical challenges are mostly rideable for a skilled rider. There were 6 of us on our ride and while we were all bucked-off at various places, usually a couple of us would clean most features. As the name implies, the Sidewinder weaves in and out of many arroyos as you cling to the western edge of the Gunnison Gorge Wilderness Area. You will climb and descend these arroyos enjoying many slickrock drops and ledges along the way, as well as about a thousand other rocky treats. The Sidewinder is not for beginners. I would imagine they would hate it and probably wind up hurt. For a rider loving a technical, physical workout its one of the best trails I've ever ridden. It took our group 5 hours to ride the whole thing including all our breaks and lunch and all that. If you google \"Sidewinder Trail\" then you will find a map on the BLM website that shows the route and many other bailout options. Go ride it... you will not be disappointed.",

Proceed to your starting point on the road or head back the way you came. There is an excellent Shuttle for downhill laps but you must access it with permission from homeowners. On the south side above the reservoir a gravel road cuts right up the hill about 1300 feet to the top of quite possibly the most scenic subdivision in the country.
