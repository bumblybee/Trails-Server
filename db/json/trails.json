    "description": "Monagas Mountain Bike Trails are located at the municipality of Bayamon, which is inside Puerto Rico's metropolitan area. The trail network is inside the Julio E. Monagas National Park and is composed of around 15 trails that run throughout the park. They are properly identified with signs marking the entry and exit points, and direction arrows throughout the routes. They are identified at their entry points with difficulty level logos which makes it easier for newcomers to know which trail to tackle first. The park is located in which as an US Army location, so throughout the park one can see old bunkers and watch posts. The trails are composed of single-tracks with lots of roots present throughout the trails. There are some streams of water that needs to be crossed though the wooden bridges in place, and some natural \"staircases\" formed by the large roots, which combined with the uphill location of the roots and the narrow of the track throw the technical part to the mix. The list of trails currently active on the network are: -La Caverna -Mirador -El Lago -Cuesta Las Marias -Las Tablas -Magic Kingdom I -Magic Kingdom II -Los Columpios -La Ceiba -Los Picapiedras -Boys Scouts -Triple Cuesta -Blair Witch -Hobbits -Almendros As previously mentioned, the trails are located inside a forest park, so rain in the months of October to February is normal in the area which can render some of the trails unusable. But hey, it's the Caribbean! So a couple of continuous days of sun and all trails are back. For more information about this location you can call the Park offices at (787) 269-6600 &amp; (787) 269-6603.",

The Visitor Center displays artifacts from the ranching and farming history of the Hayward area. There is a blacksmith shop, a tool shop and several ranching-related displays to explore. An interesting collection of antique farm machinery outside the barn augments the display. Meyers Cottage was a popular summer home of Edith, Mildred, and Jeanette Meyers, three sisters of Alameda who were very involved in local charities and fundraisers during the early and mid 1900s. The sisters also owned the 1,200-acre Dry Creek Ranch, which was donated to the Park District in 1979 and later opened as Dry Creek Regional Park. Upon the passing of the last surviving Meyers sister, the Meyers Cottage and its garden was also donated to the Park District. The Park District plans to eventually open the cottage for receptions, weddings, and similar events, and it will also house a small visitor center.",

(take a right down the hill to get water at the well which will be on your left) 14) take a left on the main road and look for the 2nd trail entrance that does not say \"foot traffic only) 15) this will bring you up to the top of the ski mountain. ride up by the lifts but stay left. (don't ride down the mountain, or do, I haven't yet) 16) trail will be up on your left, go down the hill and take your first left back to the main road. 17) climb up the mountain on the road to the top (there is a technical way down from behind the towers up there but I haven't mapped it well yet) 18) ride back down the dirt road and head back down. 19) on the right keep an eye out for picnic tables, there is a small trail opening on the right, take that 20) take a right at the end and follow any path back down to Wadhams road. from there you can ride back to eli bunker direct or back down the way you came up. Hope we can find more trails in here. Looks promising. Not a much singletrack but very rideable and a good workout.

From there you ride up the service road about 50+ feet to the beginning of section 2, which heads off into the woods down to the left includes a benched downhill trail with 2 berms and a culvert crossing. This section exits into singletrack crossing a small grassy field. Travel straight into the field 100-150 ft and enter section 3 into the woods to the right.

While at first the trails appeared to be just wide, gated gravel roads, as I continued around the park I started to find more and more singletrack. The trails were entertainingly rocky in places, and uber fast and smooth in others. Despite having a trail map, I had issues following the designated route in places. As I was nearing the end of the loop, I took a wrong turn and ended up on a different trail that took me out of the park. It conveniently led me very near to where I had parked at the park and ride, so in the end everything worked out! One word of caution: these trails are very exposed, and the majority of it has absolutely no shade or respite from the blazing sun. Ride early in the morning, or during times of the year when the temps are cooler.",

    "description": "If you like hard technical rides with some hike-a-bike this ride might be for you. it's a great ride. High Lonesome at 6 miles is a little short for me so I continue on to Caribou Trail and Strawberry West. Once you get to Strawberry West there is no easy way back I've ridden it as an out and back and as a loop. Pick your poison These are some nice technical trails with lots of natural features rocks, roots, stream crossings, bridges, logs, rocks and more rocks. Caribou Trail is like a 5 mile bushwhack! Strawberry West Trail is some sweet singletrack. This year they put in some new signs that helps. At least you know you're on the right track. Strawberry Creek Trail N9 1 from Caribou Trail to Strawberry West is more hike-a-bike to a phenomenal downhill run From Devils Thumb Trailhead follow Devils Thumb Trail a short distance to High Lonesome Trail. Follow High Lonesome Trail to The Junco Lake parking area 6mi. total. Head out of the parking lot to FS 129 turn right follow the road about Â½ way around Meadow Creek Reservoir turn right on FS 857.2 watch for Caribou Trail to take off on the right. The trail is blazed and still hard to follow but generally follows the creek. Left when you reach Strawberry West Trail ride up to FS 129 turn left to FS 128 right back to where you parked.

This write up covers the section of the trail which runs from Harford Road to Pleasantville Road and is approximately 10 miles out and back. From the parking lot on the Baltimore County (south) side of the Little Gunpowder, enter the trail. Trail head is right in the middle of the lot. Follow the trail along the Little Gunpowder. There are four stream crossings and some nice rock gardens along the trail to Bottom road. When the trail exits onto Bottom Road, go right across the bridge over the Little Gunpowder River. Continue on Bottom Road until you pass Laurel Brook Road on your right. Just past Laurel Brook Road, enter the trail again on the left. The entry is a nice steep uphill climb to a flat trail. This section of the trail is an old railroad bed, so it's pretty flat for about .75 miles. At several points you can see the Little Gunpowder on your left down in the valley. Continue on the old rail trail until it abruptly ends, then turn left. There is a nice little 2 ft. drop around the first turn. The trail continues towards Pleasantville Road, with a couple of nice uphill sections and some rooty, technical downhill sections. Once you've reached Pleasantville Road, take a left on Pleasantville and ride across the bridge over the Little Gunpowder. Be careful here! The cars headed northbound on Pleasantville have a sharp, almost blind turn to get onto the bridge. Just over the bridge, lift your bike over the guard rail and onto the trail again. You're now in the Balto county again. The first section of trail has a nice, technical downhill section to a small stream crossing. The trail on this side of the L'il Gunpowder has some swooping up and downhill sections with stream crossings at the terminus of each downhill. Some fun technical sections, too. Continue along this trail until it dumps you out onto Bottom Road again. Come out of the woods and go left on Bottom, back down towards the L'il Gunpowder. Enter the woods on the right before you cross the bridge and backtrack along the little Gunpowder towards Hardord Road. At two of the stream crossings on this leg there are side loops that follow the streams uphill, cross the stream, the follow it back downhill. One of them has a nice, small waterfall at the top. This is a multi-use trail, and during the summer sections of it can be overgrown. Sticker bushes, the unofficial MD state flower. ",

At over a thousand acres, this large preserve hosts various wildlife habitats, but most importantly, it contains one of the largest unbroken blocks of grassland habitats in the county. This grassland is home to several uncommon bird species, including Henslow's sparrow, bobolink, eastern meadowlark, grasshopper sparrow, and savannah sparrow; and while currently it is composed of many non-native species, the District is working to reintroduce native grasses to this significant area.",

    "description": "This trail description is South-to-North. You will want a shuttle vehicle at the other trailhead off H75 Road. We used Peach Valley Road to drop the shuttle at that end. The Sidewinder Trail is a relentless, rocky, technical, physical adventure on the bike. There are very few extended climbs or downhills, but my GPS still measured 2500' of climbing and 3000' of total descending by the time we were done. Mostly it is a constant mind-game of rocky, technical bike-handling tests. There are very few sections of fast cruising. The trail is extremely well-built though so the technical challenges are mostly rideable for a skilled rider. There were 6 of us on our ride and while we were all bucked-off at various places, usually a couple of us would clean most features. As the name implies, the Sidewinder weaves in and out of many arroyos as you cling to the western edge of the Gunnison Gorge Wilderness Area. You will climb and descend these arroyos enjoying many slickrock drops and ledges along the way, as well as about a thousand other rocky treats. The Sidewinder is not for beginners. I would imagine they would hate it and probably wind up hurt. For a rider loving a technical, physical workout its one of the best trails I've ever ridden. It took our group 5 hours to ride the whole thing including all our breaks and lunch and all that. If you google \"Sidewinder Trail\" then you will find a map on the BLM website that shows the route and many other bailout options. Go ride it... you will not be disappointed.",

    "description": "Found this description online: This is locally known as the \"slashing road\" section of the North Country Trail, and is an absolutely awesome section. Locals generally ride from the South to the North and avoid much of the sandy two-track. Starting at the intersection of Thumb Lake &amp; Slashing road, take the trail north following the blue blazes on the trees (re-marked spring 2009, very easy to follow) after several miles of flowy single track, cross chandler hill rd. (paved) and then begin a grinding uphill on a fairly decent two-track. At the top of this climb is a real treat if you know what to look for...on the right side is a faintly visible single track that has been built and maintained by a local guy who lives nearby. This \"bootleg\" section is not marked, but generally easy to follow and forms a 5 mile loop that re-connects with the NTC about a mile from your point of origin. This makes for an awesome 11 miles of riding on mostly single track, while eliminating all of the sandy two-tracks and paved roads in the trails.com description. The soils here drain well, so this is a good choice when other trails are too muddy to ride. First timers should take a good topo map and a compass or gps, since the area is criss-crossed with old logging roads and it can be easy to get lost if you get off-track. There are other sections of the North Country Trail, but I haven't ridden them yet. Directions are available on Latitude 45's website (Petoskey bike shop). I've been unable to find any descriptions online. ",

    "description": "This trail is only open from October 15 - April 15. This trail is very worn and is more suitable to hiking, but it is an interesting bike trail nonetheless. Start from the parking lot and ride across the paved bridge. Continue on the paved road to the right through the campground guard gate. Ride to the end of the campground, staying straight on the paved road. Eventually you will see a sign for the North Slope trail on the left. Follow the orange blazes. At the beginning, the trail follows the river and is a nice leisurely ride. Next, expect a couple of insanely impossible climbs (if anyone has ever ridden this part of the trail without getting off, you are a liar). Once you reach the top of the mountain you will see the Art Loeb hiking trail to the right. Continue left, following the orange blazes. From here the trail follows the side of the mountain and begins its slow descent. Along this part of the trail there are cool views of the mountain and a couple of impossible foot bridges. I actually fell off the side of the mountain at one point as my back tire slid out on some roots. The trail is pretty rock and rooty in places, so be careful. The last part of the trail is a pretty steep descent and ends up in one of the campsites. Follow the pavement back to your car. Have fun and be careful on the slick roots and bridges.",

The trails are marked very well and there are a lot of points where you can get off the trail or join on it to make your own personalized ride. It is easy enough for the not so experienced, but it can be a good ride for the experts as well. Not the most technical or the hardest workout in the world, just moderate, but had to rate it a 10 overall and the goofy rating system wouldn't let me unless i rated the technical aspects a 10. (One side note - no logs or rock gardens or any rooty areas). About 98% single track with a little two track in there. Its a very smooth ride with a bunch of different areas along the trail. You start with mild hills and lots of smooth turns and small elevation changes. It goes into a more open straight away area, then into the climbs. This is a smooth ride with lots of different terrain (being half deciduous and half coniferous). Its got switchbacks, fair climbs, differing types of climbs, smooth terrain, and a great layout.

    "description": "The Aska Trail System is Blue Ridge's premiere local singletrack trail system. It features about 15 miles of beautiful, narrow singletrack. Individual trails in the system include the renowned Stanley Gap trail as well as Green Mountain, Long Branch, and the Flat Creek Loop. Some of the singletrack is relatively smooth and flowy, and other parts are super steep and technical. But no matter what you decide to hit, one thing is certain: it's all good!",

    "description": "Two lick is a short very smooth singletrack loop trail that can be ridden in either direction. However it is best ridden counter clockwises. Two Lick Bottom Trail splits Two Lick trail into two parts and can be ridden to add miles to the 5 mile main loop. Our favorite is to ride it counter-clockwise, then start back up again and come down Two Lick Bottom. This makes for 8 or 9 miles and if you come out of Two Lick Bottom and then do the loop clockwise (totally different feel) you can get just short of 15 miles. Great trail for beginners to expert. The trail climbs a bunch, not real steep, just long. Do not bail out though because your climb will be rewarded with over half of the 5 mile loop being an easy rolling narrow downhill singletrack. There is one bridge on the access trail, one on Two Lick trail and three on Two Lick Bottom trail. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RIDE THESE BRIDGES. EXTREMELY SLICK - ALWAYS !",

    "description": "Mitchell Memorial Forest is a Hamilton County (Ohio) Park and the Mountain Bike trail within the forest was built by the volunteer members of CORA (Cincinnati Off Road Alliance) with the permission, support and help of Hamilton County Parks. This great relationship and the hard work of many volunteers has resulted in a terrific 4 mile loop built very carefully to IMBA standards. The trail is 95% singletrack with nice, gradual elevation change. Terrific maintenance and several whoop-dee-doo roller coaster sections throughout keep the flow rolling while some great switchbacks, narrow between the tree passages, rock gardens and a log-over or two make this trail great for the Beginner and fun for the intermediate rider as well. Those looking for a workout can ride the loop a few times in either direction thanks to the fact that the trail is non-directional and both ends are located opposite one another in the parking lot. Please help CORA keep this a terrific trail by following IMBA's rules of the trail- Resist the urge to ride when the trail system is wet. Enjoy your ride at Mitchell Memorial Forest.",

Hikers have it on weekends and share during the week. PLEASE honor this as the park has opened this great trail up to bikers on an experimental basis with future trails open to bikers if this works out! This trail is located in the Bandy Creek area of Big South Fork. You can park at the visitor center or the swimming pool (N36 29.419 W084 41.872). for an additional round trip distance of 9 miles on easy gravel roads (total of 16 miles). You can drive to the trailhead but there is tight parking for only 2 or 3 vehicles with the last couple of miles of road single lane traffic. If you elect to ride the whole distance, you can ride an additional 2.3 miles of singletrack on the Duncan Hollow trail; accessible app. 1.5 miles from the swimming pool. To get to the trail head: drive or ride from the swimming pool area (near Visitor Center) on the Duncan Hollow gravel road bearing to the right after app. 2 miles at N36 30.553 W084 40.789. This road to the right is Smith ridge but it was not signed. This singletrack loop can be ridden either counter or clockwise and appears to be slightly harder counterclockwise.

Also, please don't pay too much attention to the trail length I gave. I honestly can't tell you how far back this goes. This place has a good bit of variety, but it is mostly rocky/root-y single track that you'll be crawling up or flying down. There are some features mixed into the trails. A large 15+ foot log with the top hacked flat crosses a stream, a rather arbitrary boardwalk which reaches about 10 feet tall x 30 feet long you can ride down through the pine trees, and a dirt jump section which includes a few smaller jumps, an inclined log, some random log I think you're supposed to hop onto, and the coolest thing, a 3 foot high jump which throws you onto a steep decline at the bottom of which begins a 20 foot boardwalk/ramp that ends with a 6 - 7 foot gap. I ate dirt my first and only time, and my shin's still numb from where I banged it on the ground. So, Fox Park definitely has some cool stuff and it needs to really be explored! A lot of stream crossings could be cause for some more bridges, because I find myself walking across more than riding through. The best strategy, I think, is to climb to the highest point you can, which inevitably leads to the dirt jump section ... maybe. Honestly, someone needs to map that place. It's also a place where some swamp walks could be a huuuuuuuuuuge benefit. Anybody looking to develop a trail, check out Fox Park!",

It seems like you go downhill more than up, even with all the gradual elevation changes. Its not really rutted up like you would think a motor trail would be, but I was very happy for the banked turns on some of the blind downhills. An added bonus for this ride is the ability to change things up if you want and jump on the many oil lease roads that traverse the loop. (GPS highly recommended for that).

    "description": "Updated Description 9/15/13 by mtbgreg1: Blankets Creek is one of the premiere mountain bike trail systems in the Atlanta Metro Area. While perhaps not technically in the metro area (depends who you ask), this Woodstock trail is close enough to the city to draw a flood of riders up here every day of the week. Thanks to the popularity, SORBA Woodstock has recently been able to vastly expand the parking area and add new trailhead facilities, such as flush toilets. As for the trails themselves, Blankets Creek is an excellent example of a stacked-loop trail system. Short, flat, easy trails are accessible right from the parking lot for beginner riders, but keep heading further in and you'll experience intermediate singletrack as well as advanced trails full of rocks, jumps, berms, and some serious exposure. While Blankets is definitely busy and can get crowded sometimes, the reputation and the popularity has been well-earned. Directional travel (depending on day) helps keep the trails from feeling too congested once you get away from the parking lot, so if you have never ridden at Blankets Creek before, be sure to carve time out of your schedule to do so! Previous Description: Several singletrack loops at the edge of Lake Allatoona including the Van Michael, Dwelling, and South loops. Good signage and directional travel by day. Beginner: 2.0 Miles Total Intermediate: 4.2 Miles Total Advanced: 8.1 Miles Total Expert (Downhill): .25 Miles Total",

It's marked with an orange flag and called something like Perfect Ride?. Once you find the singletrack on the right of the fireroad, you've got about 5 miles of super plush super fun singletrack dirt through lots and lots of pines etc. Just follow the orange flags and it's pretty obvious where to go. There are a couple fireroad crossings, but if you look around, you'll see the trail just a few feet up the road at each crossing. At the one unmarked singletrack Y, just after a creek crossing and about 4 miles in, go right. Left goes uphill, right downhill. About 5 miles in you'll cross through a meadow, and then do 5-10 minutes of singletrack climbing, topping out at a fireroad. At the \"Y\", go LEFT. This is really the only completely unmarked decision you make. The fireroad climbs a bit (15 minutes+), opens up to huge views of Lake Isabella, and then BOMBS (to the LEFT) down the rest of the mountain. Two + more miles, at the only other \"Y\", which is more like a \"T\", go right. (Left at the first one, right at the second) It smoothes out there and really rips. Be heads up for trucks. This road will take you all the way back to the main drag, just south of town. Another option is to go right at the \"T\". This will bypass the only real bummer of a climb and take you to the bottom of Sawmill road. There are several turnouts at the bottom to park a shuttle car.",

There area number of very good views. The trail involves a lot of climbing. If you proceed West there is another trailhead that passes a road an connects to another system. The next section of trail after the road is a good ride as well. After that (further West) it becomes very sandy and I will not ride that section again. If you proceed East from the Redbird Trailhead there is another section of trail with another 5 miles of trail or more. Again, there is a lot of climbing but very good views, including of Devil's Gate. If you don't like climbing this trail is probably not for you. But I went up to Johnson Peak from I belive a clockwise direction, and the downhill and Johnson Peak is extremely fast and reminded me of a pump track in one section. I enjoyed the system and it reminded me of riding in Idaho with the topography and rocks.

At the end of the aqueduct the trail turns to the left uphill. The next few miles is nicely flowing singletrack. It does'nt get any better than this.

It does have a few wood bridge crossings, but nothing really exciting. It's a place to go play around and get wet and muddy. Huguenot Trail will come out onto Riverside Drive, and from there you can follow the James River and ride on the blacktop (Riverside Drive) down to the Pony Pasture.

It is all rough gravel and crushed stone and, like Huguenot Trail, it is totally flat, but does have a few muddy sections and wet sand sections. There are no wood bridge crossings, log jumps, ravines, etc... It does have a few hidden single track sections here and there that connect up through the woods. On weekends, it is best to avoid the area due to crowds - especially in the summertime. But it is a nice local place to practice speed and traction control in the mud.

    "description": "Begin your ride at the parking area at Beavertown just south of New Matamoras Ohio. Ride north on Rt.7 for about a couple miles, go past Sheets Run Rd. and take the next road to the left. This is a narrow blacktop road that will climb for a mile or so and take you to Rt.260. Go left on 260 for another couple miles and watch for the trail signs on your left near the community of Yellow House. If you come to Co. Rd. 9 you passed it. Go left onto Ohio View Trail following it, across one gravel road in a few miles. Continue till you come out in the parking area you started at. There are some nice views along the way. One is a spur on your left that climbs a short climb to an overlook. See pic. There are a few steep climbs on this trail however there are some great downhill rewards as well. The first one off Rt.260 is awesome and fast. Be carefull when you reach the steep part there is a fairly tight turn near the bottom and then you shoot across a stream to begin a climb. About 2 miles into the trail you will come to a connector trail that goes hard up a very steep climb on your right. Do not go right, stay on the trail and you will cross Sheets Run Rd. The trail continues on the other side of the road at the three way intersection. At this time the trail goes out a logging road on the left, watch for the trail diamonds (markers). I hope to post some better pictures as soon as the trail opens in April. Note, this trail is like others in the Wayne National Forest. You must obtain a permit to ride. It is easiest if you get a yearly permit and the trails open in April. When you get your permit from the Forest Office in Reno Ohio, just north of Marietta across from the Highway Patrol Station.",

Suicidal Tendencies is more advanced both technically and physically. It drops sharply about 500 feet off the mesa and makes the climb up onto the next mesa. Once you get to the loop portion, go left and you've got another 300 vertical feet of gradual climbing with a slightly steeper return to the intersection and then the plummet into the valley.

There are even a few areas of the forest in this area that are lush with undergrowth which is a rarity in northern Arizona. The route itself is interesting too. There are a number of ups and downs with some fun curves to add spice to the ride. There's even a dip or two through a rocky creek bed. Watch for wildlife along the way.

Not too far beyond Twogood Cabin starts the serious climbing, gaining close to 2000' in about 2 miles. There are many switchbacks and most are ridable is you can keep your balance and power. Porcupine Creek Trail meets Warm Springs Ridge Trail #177, go hard left. The trail stays near the top of the ridge rolling up and down for the next 3 miles where you come to an old hunting camp. Here the trail seems to deadend. Turn around and you will notice a faint trail taking off to the left and back toward the ridge. The descending starts soon after this. After the first section of descending, and 4 big switchbacks in the woods, the trail bottoms out and climbs briefly. Look for a sign for the Fire Creek Trail #404 on a tree on the left. Fire Creek Trail is never too steep but has many switchbacks. This is a super fun descent. Try to ride this early in the day before the lightning rakes the highcountry ridges.",

    "description": "There are several options here, and all the trails are great, but here is my favorite. From the trailhead, climb the dirt road up until you reach the first picnic shelter. Take the trail, not the road, from this shelter, which will eventually hit a double track. Taking this double track right will be a short ride and take you back to the trailhead (you pass this double track on your climb.) Take a left on this double track a short way until you reach several trails leading away where the double track ends. Take the trail on the slight right, which winds a bit all the way down into the canyon, where it meets another double track (going right.) Keep your eyes open for a single track coming off this double track (if you hit pavement, backtrack a bit...) to the left. Follow the one-way signs all the way down, through a dry (mostly) creek bed, under a concrete overpass, and take the steep, short hill up to the parking lot. From here, take Highland drive again to the left with a good climb on a paved road to reach the trailhead where you parked. For a much longer ride, keep going past the first picnic shelter to the second, and enjoy the falls. There are tons of other trails back there and they all eventually lead down and out of the canyon at mostly the same points. ",

    "description": "Once you turn into the trail it is all a network of intercrossing and connecting trails. It was explained to me as one big clover leaf, thats why I named it Clover Leaf, but it is anything but. It looks nothing like a clover leaf...ironic. I was told to always take the straight path and it will all connect back onto itself. At every intersection I did just that and I just kept riding and riding. It did double back over itself a few times but It seemed like an endless trail. It was my first time, it was raining and it was getting dark fast. We rode for just over an hour and never let up. the trail system is amazing and fast with an awesome flow. I imagine it is a local secret, so I apologize for letting the cat out of the bag, but this trail is too nice to be a secret. The Bike Beat is a local bike shop less than a mile from this trail and a must visit store, amazing service and a great staff. I am from out of town, they fixed my bike and showed me the way to this amazing trail. If the sun didn't set, we would have ridden this trail for at least another hour or more. Very fast, the perfect ratio of climbs and descents, a few jumps and obsticles well placed along the trail. I think it eventually connects with a series of walking paths from some of the nearby housing areas because we came across some benches and ended up poking out of the woods at some houses before ducking back in. This will be on my list of trails to visit again when I return to the area. Very similar ride to New Quarter Park as far as the flow. Missed Freedom due to the rain, that is close by as well. So if you are like me, this trail can be ridden with a visit to an amazing shop for some rest and replenishment before heading down the road to hit another great trail. Probably can get more than 8 miles out of it, but that is how far we rode that night.",

Two distinct areas define this park: the reservoir, which offers a host of water-oriented recreational activities, and the adjoining \"back country\" which reveals to the visitor California Oak woodland, chapparal riparian plant communities and associated wildlife habitats. During the months of March, April and May the \"back country\" offers a spectacular display of wildflowers. In addition, the park offers breathtaking views of southern Santa Clara County and the surrounding Santa Cruz Mountain Range.

    "description": "This is one of the premier shuttle rides in the state and with good reason. With over 30 miles of mostly singletrack trails and all of the best scenery Colorado has to offer, this trail is a must ride. As a shuttle ride you'll climb about 2,300 feet (much of it above 11,000 feet) and you'll descent about 6,000 feet total. The first part of the ride is above treeline and is not technical in any way. You'll top out at about 11,960 feet and then begin the first major descent down an old fire road to Marshall Pass (this is about the 10 mile mark). From here you can choose to descend down more fire road to the bottom or you can climb up the Rainbow Trail (recommended). Here you'll find some dense forest sections and some steeper climbs. Finally, head left onto the Silver Creek trail and follow this baby all the way down to a forest service road. The Silver Creek trail is pretty technical with some large scree fields, switchbacks, and some rough sections of trail. At the end of the singletrack you'll ride through a large streambed and out to the forest road. Go down a bit here until you see a sign for the Rainbow Trail. Here you can take the Rainbow Trail back to US 285 or stay on the road for a quicker descent. An awesome ride, do it if you get the chance but watch for thunderstorms and be prepared for a long day. Shuttle services are available, check the internet for more information. Trail is usually open (read: clear of snow) from July to August.",

It is approximately 8 miles out to Stormy Peak Lookout on this trail, then 4 miles via trail from Stormy Peak down the Virginia Gulch Trail to the Road in the bottom of Pine Creek. It is about a quarter mile on primitive road from the trail end to the Pine Creek Road. From there it is 4.3 miles to the Salmon River Bridge, then upriver on the Salmon River Road 1.6 miles to Shoup, Idaho, where your well deserved cold ones await you at the Shoup Store. This description is for a shuttle ride, however you can do a fine out and back ride from Haystack Mountain to Stormy Peak Lookout and back. The trail dropping down Virginia Gulch is steep and would be a very hard climb coming back up. The top of Haystack Mtn is 8,800 feet in elevation. Stormy Peak Lookout is 7,945 feet in elevation. The singletrack trail where it meets the road in Pine Creek is 4,800 feet in elevation. The road at the Salmon River Crossing is at 3,400 feet in elevation. The trail descending down Virginia Gulch from Stormy Peak is suitable for advanced riders due to trail difficulty. If you just did an out and back from Haystack Mountain to Stormy Peak Lookout and back to Haystack Mountain, intermediate riders should be able to handle this section with appropriate fitness and preparation. Contact the Salmon/Cobalt and North Fork Ranger District Offices for trail and road conditions. Due to elevations and snow conditions this ride is probably only open July-September.",

Weaving up and down several times in a large hollow, it is a constant challenge to novice and advanced riders alike. This is some unique terrain, heavily wooded, very dark and shady, with several rock-bottom creek crossings. Due to the steepness of the terrain, the area wasn't logged so it presents an uncommon setting with low volume mid-level growth, and tall old-growth trees forming a high, dark canopy. It almost has the feel of a natural amphitheater. The trail surface is mostly dirt, with several veins of rock, and rocky creek crossings/waterfalls. Stop and look around when you reach the bottom of the valley. The trail should be ridden both clockwise and counter-clockwise; each offers its own pleasures. GORC recently rerouted one of the fall-line climbs which had become unsustainable, but there are still plenty of opportunities to get your climbing in.(pasted from gorctrails.com)",

    "description": "This loop combines various sections of trail into a ride that can be done in under a few hours. It is mostly mellow forest riding, a few miles of road, a few miles of uphill climbing, and some fairly fast but unremarkable downhill. Being in the Fraser area means that there is little true \"single track\" -- most of the trails are reclaimed forest roads that are being used as bike trails. That means don't count on much roller coaster fun riding. It is pretty much all steady grade climbs and descents, mostly straight trail without a lot of thrills. You can ride this loop clockwise or counterclockwise. Clockwise will present Tipperary as a downhill, which is preferable to riding Spruce Creek down since Spruce Creek is basically a steady grade with lots of loose rock. Tipperary, in my opinion, is the better ride down. On the other hand, riding counterclockwise means you can ride down Flume, which is one of the funner rides in the area. Don't even try to do this ride without a good map or somebody who knows the way; there are too many trails and intersections that can lead you astray. Note, if you are riding counterclockwise, when you get to the bottom of Flume, you will want to go across the creek (the fork to the left) and pick up the lower section of the Creekside trail to take you back to the road. If you ride it clockwise you can ride up Creekside instead of Flume (they both parallel the creek) and not slowdown the downhill riders on Flume.",

You will see No Trespassing signs, but if you've turned in your waiver at the Cave, you're good to go. The road has long been shut down and can now be hiked or biked free of automobiles. The canyon is so narrow in places, you won't believe it was once an auto route! Keep following the road. When it switchbacks left, go straight on to the singlegrack. It's about 3 miles until the trail exits up on Rampart Range Road. The grade is tough in places and much of the trail is jagged, jumbled rocks that will cause numerous dismounts. As a climb, it's positively brutal. Even downhill, this will cause a number of hike-a-bikes. If you don't want to do the out-and-back climb, you can access the trail from above two ways. One way is to ride up the Rampart Range Road and look for the singletrack on the left near the old shooting range. Get the Pikes Peak Atlas map by Robert Ormes and Robert Houdek for the approximate location of the trail. This map also shows where you can drop into Williams about halfway in from the Waldo Canyon loop. The canyon is spectacular and the adventurous will find this an attractive outing despite the difficulties involved. It's a real backcountry adventure starting right on the edge of the city.",

    "description": "This was a difficult trail Two days and I was only able to find and ride about 20 miles of the trail. This is cattle country and there are livestock trails that have been used since the end of the 19th century by vaqueros from South America to add to the confusion. Bears Ears Trail is not well marked and I was confused more than once. There are three short trail spurs that leave the reservoir and campground area, these all intersect with Trail #1144 up the drainages of Cottonwood and Taylor Creeks (approximately 1-1/2 miles from the recreation area). The first day I took the horse trail from Freeman Reservoir to Bears Ears Trail then followed Bears Ears to Rd 110. This was a tough ride up and down through a beautiful aspen grove. Some rocky some smooth. I got lost and barely made it back before dark. The second day was even harder! Took the trail from the lake to Bears Ears Trail to Sand Point and was planning on ridding the loop in a clockwise direction. At every intersection it was a coin toss on witch way to go! The description I read said that here were only a few steep sections. It must have been reviewed for hiking I thought there was lots of climbing all the way past Drainage Divide! Had to push my bike up to Buck Point 10,500 ft. This side of the mountain is mostly Spruce forest. The trail is steep and rocky. I had to bail on West Prong Road (rd.133) back to RD 110. My chain broke a couple miles from camp. This trail is definitely a challenge and I will be back. If you like hard rides with a sense of adventure and not afraid of being lost or caught out after dark this is a good ride. . I consider myself lucky to have made it back by dark both days. Bears Ears Trail can also be accessed from Black Mountain and California Park ",

Continue riding down Gazos Creek keeping your speed in check as this road often contains fallen trees and landslides. Around the three mile mark the trail is blocked by a landslide containing trees and boulders, ride as many of these obstacles as your skills allow. You will pass a small creek on your right and then the trial cuts back to the left and begins to climb up and down to the crossroads. At the crossroads Gazos Creek, White Canyon and Johansen roads intersect. Turn right at the private residence and then turn right again in less than .1mi onto Johansen Road heading towards North China Grade. The road continues to climb up above the residence as it places you onto the toughest climbing sections of the trial. You will continue to climb up and be afforded beautiful views of the forest.

Most of this trail is pretty wide open desert riding, fun and fast it has a bit of a roller coaster feel to its flow. From the Pemberton there are several trails that lead out like spokes from a hub, the Scenic Loop tr is a 3 mile loop that is popular with the equestrian group. The Rock Knob tr, the Coach Whip trail is access to the Windmill tr that goes up and over the mountains to the Gateway Trail system. The Dixie Mine tr leads to the site of an abandon mine and also joins trails that lead to the Bell Pass (Lost Dog area) and also into the community of Fountain Hills. These trails are all well signed however it is advisable to pick up a free map at the Visitors Center for all the side trails but the Pemberton Loop itself is easily done without a map. If you happen to run across horse crap on the trails we cant really blame the equestrian folks as there are about a dozen wild horses roaming the park here too.

    "description": "The trailhead starts at the new gravel parking lot on Historic Springfield Road past the park campground. Ride the old wagon trail into the woods past the hiking trail entrance (no bikes on that please) and then a left goes to the North Loop (clockwise), a right goes to the South Loop (counter-clockwise). The North Loop features winding rolling hills and a couple of wonderful stream crossings. These will be dry beds during the Summer. Some tight turns and a few rocks are the most technical parts of this section. You'll follow a seasonal stream a bit and shortly after crossing it you'll start a short climb with one switchback. Roll through the hardwoods punctuated by cedar trees. You'll cross a fire break a couple of times, make sure to stay on the trail (straight ahead). After a couple of miles of riding you'll enter a section known as \"The North 40\" that starts with a bunch of fast rollers before eventually crossing a stream and then heads up through switchback and a few non-technical rocks before getting to a highpoint. Enjoy the winding downhill that follows until you come out onto a fire break. Follow the fire break to the next stream crossing. You are now on the South Loop, shortly after crossing the stream you'll head up to a tough, steep turn to the right. Never fear, after the turn you'll have a gradual uphill section on wide, non-technical trail for less than a tenth of a mile. At this point, open up the throttle. The next 3 1/2 miles is easy, flowing trail slowly making it's way down the south side of the hill. One short climb in the middle brings you to the ridge again. Soon you'll come around a point on the ridge that during leaf off, overlooks Lake Bennett. Have fun, keep your speed in check depending on your skill level and enjoy the next 3/4 mile of hill hugging downhill. At the bottom you'll cross a substantial bridge and a few hundred feet later you'll arrive back at the Springfield Trail. A left turn will take you back to the parking lot, straight ahead will let you do it all again.",

The descent is very typical of BC trails-gentle, good flow, but a lot of the cat litter gravel everywhere, so you don't have a ton of traction. On a side-note, it's called Nice Kitty due to the local wildlife, so keep your eyes open.",

Find the signs that show you to the trail and head north for about a mile where the trail crosses the road (it's now called Deckers Road - either way, it's CR126).Cross the road and go about 4.5 miles until you get to road 538. Pay Close Attention here. The Colorado Trail continues across the road, but don't follow it. Turn left on the forest road and go just under a tenth of a mile and look for the trail on your right. The trail, being seldom used, is a little hard to see. Look for a sign that says \"No Motor Vehicles\" and a little gap in the gate. This is the trail. Go up about Â¾ of a mile and reach the rocks. Chair Rocks has got to be one of the great unsung heros of Front Range mountain biking. The tread is mostly smooth, if not a little loose in spots, the hills are gentle and the singletrack is seemingly endless as it winds its way in and out of the Buffalo Creek burn area, around, near and right up into some really groovy rock formations. There's great wildlife watching, flowers, expansive vistas, breathtaking valleys and hardly another human soul on the trail. If you bring a camera, plan on adding at least an additional hour to your ride time and bring lots of film/card space. Also, bring a pair of walking shoes. You will want to walk around the rocks where your cleats can do a lot of damage. Awesome views of Raleigh Peak to the east, Long Scraggy Peak to the south and once you get up to the Chair Rocks, Banner Peak and the Cathedral Spires to the north.",

Supposedly there is some singletrack out here but I never found it (I suspect it had been closed for some time, too many motorized vehicles using it probably). The trail was super muddy but there was no one out here. I did find a pretty sweet granite chute on part of the trail, that was pretty much the highlight. Looking at a map of the area it appears that you can connect to some singletrack (trail 692 I think) but I got bored with the trail way too soon (plus it started getting really rocky).

    "description": "The trail begins with a short uphill climb and you will quickly come upon a gate to your left. Go through this gate and turn right. PLEASE NOTE: The gate is closed from October 1st until May 1st, which leaves you with the Elder Fehn Trail (Also good) to ride. Once through the gate travel south towards the Peak. This short down hill section is named the Limber Pine Trail. At the bottom of Limber Pine, turn left and travel across the dirt road to access the trail. The trail weaves through a wetlands area for a couple hundred yards and then leads into the forest along the banks of North Catamount. Through this section there are a couple good climbs that lead you away from the reservoir. Once you've reached the top of the last climb there is double track along a high ridge, which offers beautiful glimpses of Pikes Peak. The trail quickly descends a pretty beat up, rooted, washed out section and drops you into a dirt Cul-de-sac. A short distance away there is an intersection, which leads down to both South and North Catamount Reservoirs. Go straight and ride on Ridge Trail Road until you reach the dam. *There may be some single track along the bank of North Catamount, but the dirt road offers a quick pace and a moment to rest your legs.* Cross the dam and look for \"Trail\" signs on your left that will lead you back to the banks of the lake. This is a great section that meanders in and out of coves, much like Rampart Reservoir, but easier. Eventually the single track drops into another dirt Cul-de-sac. There are two roads leading out and one single track. The single track follows the lake, but is less defined. The less traveled road is also a good option. If you are beat, you can take the main road back out. The single track will lead you back to Limber Pines trail, which you would return on. The two roads entail an uphill climb that intersect with the Catamount road. Turn left once you reach this road. Once on the road look for an access point on your right hand side for the upper portion of the Limber Pines trail, which is also part of the Ring the Peak trail. This short portion of single track will take you back to the gate and back to the parking lot. If for some reason you miss the access point, you will eventually come back down to the reservoir where you would take the Limber Pine trail back up the way you came down. Please Note: I labeled this trail as single track because a large portion is. However, a quarter of the trail is on dirt roads.",

    "description": "**Check below for the most recent updates** Mostly singletrack with very few woods roads. The area is developed specifically for mountain bikers and has berms, log rides, and jumps/drop offs constructed by volunteers. The riding is mostly flowy XC with some technical sections mixed in and plenty of big hits off to the side for you free ride guys. New trails are under construction too! UPDATE 5/2014: Dirt Church has been opened with another trail on the way. Also, a pump track has been constructed too! UPDATE 9/2015: Permission was recently granted to add in another 2.5 miles of trail to connect the Renee's Way parking lot to Bambi on flat terrain. Along with the 2.5 mile beginner's trail, a more technical spur will be added off of the new trail for advanced riders. UPDATE 1/2016: The new trails are open for riding, but be careful as there are lots of small roots and stumps that need to be cut down further. Although the trail is fresh and fairly soft I see a lot of potential in it. UPDATE 5/2016: The new trails, Erratica and Beeline are running great. Both trails are still a little soft, but all of the features on Erratica make the loop a ton of fun. Skinnies and other obstacles are in no short supply; there is even a see-saw. And to top it all off, there is a super flowy jump line at the end of the trail with 8-10 jumps. I highly recommend trying this one! Stay tuned for more updates",

ATLANTIC COUNTY TRAIL VOLUNTEERS have built 4 miles of continues single track. We will have 8 miles of single track when we complete the trail (hopfully sometime in the Spring of 2003). The Duck Farm Trail is in the North End of the Park. The trail system isn't marked yet....so the best bet to finding the trail is, vist the Parks Nature Center. The park ranger or naturalist will be able to guide you. Remember, this trail was designed and built by Mountain Bikers...although it's very flat in South Jersey..we've made it as challenging as we could. Also remember....MTBers have the right of way! be polite and say hello to all trail users (if you see horses on the trail, please report it to the park...they aren't allowed on the trail!) The Duck Farm Trail is the only legal single track in Atlantic County, NJ. So take care of it.....WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT! HAVE FUN!!!!!!If you want to become a member of ACTV and help build the trail we can be contacted at Atlanticcountytrailvolunteers@MSN.com. our web page is www.geocities.com/actv03/ ",

    "description": "Well groomed singletrack. Fast and fun when it's dry. If the ground is wet you might want to think about going to another place. The best thing to do is to get a copy of the White Clay Creek map and fill in the trails at the Trailhead Map for Middle Run. The Lenape Trail makes a loop around the entire natural area and is a pretty fun loop. Try Following this or just get lost and rip around until you pop back out at the Parking area. I'll try to explain a decent loop, but it's best to figure it out on your own.At the trailhead map you will see singletrack to your right thru the field. Take this into the woods and follow it staying to your right until you get to a bridge that crosses Middle Run. After you cross the bridge you will pass a fallen tree that has been flattened on top so you can ride across it. Hang to your left and climb the trail to the top of the hill. Hang right and follow the Double track size trail down around the green water tower. This connects to the Snow Goose trail which consists of 3 spurs all connecting together. I usually hang left and follow it down to the creek and head right along the creek all the way back to the bridge. Cross back over the bridge and follow the way you came staying to the Right as trails split off to the left. This is now the Tri Valley Trail/Lenape Trail. Follow this across Fox Den Road and past Deacon's Walk Spur. You will come to an intersection of two trails. Going straight will pop you out in a development and onto Smith Mill Road. Follow this straight across Paper Mill Road to White Clay Creek State Park. Or to stay in Middle Run hang a Left up thru the field. This is a continuation of the Lenape Trail. Follow it back across Fox Den Road and stay on the Lenape Trail, there are small signs. You will come out on a Dirt road at the turn in to were you parked. Go straight across the road and get onto Double Horseshoe Trail, follow this across Possom Hollow Road down into the woods on the otherside. You can really rip thru here. Keep on the main trail it will meet back up with Lenape Trail. Take the Chapel Hill spur around. At the 3 way intersection hand Left back down into the woods. You will pop out back down at Middle Run across from the Snow Goose trail. Here you can either cross the creek on the stepping stone and follow it back or hang a left back up over the hill on Possum Hollow Trail and head right back to the trail head. This is a good place to get lost and there is no doubt my trail directions are lacking a bit. There are new trails that are not on the maps so it's easy to head the wrong way. So follow these directions loosely and have fun.",

This is a great trail for beginners as it is the easiest one. I recommend Blue diamond route as it's the easiest. Road continually changes making good practice with variety of asphalt, gravel, dirt, and plain old root earth. Great scenery, historical buildings. You'll notice a horse stable in one part where you'll see an old house built in the 1800's. Very cool. Up ahead further, there are plenty of streams where you can stop and have a picnic, picnic benches, horse routes, covered bridges, and the fair hill stables where horses have the first yield.

    "description": "This is a fun, short loop which is part of the much bigger Fair Hills NRMA. I got a little squirrely hopping over one jump and hit a fallen tree with my right arm, causing me to bounce off and land head down, downhill in a pretty thick sticker bush - hence the name, courtesy of my fiancee. Head west out of the parking lot and turn right on the gravel doubletrack and follow it for about 3000 ft. Turn left into the woods at the Yellow trail marker. The first section of this loop trends down towards Big Elk Creek and is really run. It looks like they've run a race here recently as there are many bermed turns and lots of jumps! If I'm not mistaken, this section of trail is called \"Drunken Sailor\". Follow it down to the creek and turn left on the doubletrack. Follow the doubletack along the creek (or the singletrack slightly uphill in the woods) to the Ridge Trail leading to South Park. Take the low singletrack along the creek to the lower entrance gate of South Park. Follow fun singletrack through South Park to the upper gate. Exit the gate and follow the ridge trail back to Big Elk Creek. Hop back on the Yellow blazed trail and ride uphill back to the parking lot - then repeat the whole thing. We rode the same loop twice just to get back into the bermed turns and jumps on the section running down to Big Elk Creek! (This is my second trail submission. The first one had about a million waypoints listed. I cleaned this one up a little.)",

    "description": "There are a few different ways to piece these Three Loops together. I usually do it this way due to this being the way I get to the trails riding from my place. From the Trailhead at Bryan's Field Trail follow the trail to the Left just past the Map. Follow the Loop around back to the trail head. Go back thru the parking lot and make a Left on the Road until you see the signs for the Whitely Farms Trail. I usually Split this loop in half, doing half the loop then breaking off to do David English, than on my way back to the trail head I hit the other half. Turn Right onto Whitely Farms Trail and follow the loop around back out to the dirt road (labeled Smith Mill Road/Tri Valley Trail on the Map). Turn Right on the road and cross over Pleasant Hill Road staying to your Right. Follow the David English Trail around to the Park Office. Continue on the trail behind the Park Office and back around to where you crossed Pleasant Hill Road. Once back across hang a Right onto the other Half of Whitely Farms Trail. You can either follow this back up to the road and make a right back to the trail head or dump off a bit early on a trail to the right that connects back to Bryan's Field and follow that to the Trailhead. There are midway cut offs on Bryan's and David English so if you want to do the whole loop make sure you don't cut off early. If you want to double back to this them though they are fun to rip down. Namely the one on Bryan's Field heading West to East past the Mason Dixon Monument. Also: Check out the Skills Course on Bryan's Field.",

Then there are some parts with steeper declines that, in the summer especially, you have to make it over flooded areas on wood bridges that can be sometimes tricky to get on to, depending on what roots or rocks the most recent rains have uncovered at the bridge lips.There are technically two trails of note for mountain bikers looking for a little technical fun, and then there's a connecting third that's longer but flat and really is a good trek if you want to see some of the Central Florida environment and wildlife, but it's for hiking mostly, and not technical at all really.The two trails for MTB are both to the left when you're entering through the main entrance by way of the school.The first and more technical and long of the two trails is the first one off to the left when entering by way of the middle school. This trail will take you through the woods and up and down a bit, over a few bridges. It eventually opens up into a wood flat area where local bikers have attempted to put different features like ramps and drops and tabletops. Not the best in the world, but it's local and cared for, so I won't bash it, I love it. Anyway, you can continue on past the flat area till you get to a clearing where there's an overpass. The overpass is a major highway, so you'll go under it, on a small but fun kind of a skinny where if you aren't paying attention you can end up in the creek. You can opt not to follow the skinny and just ride the concrete bumps made as a part of the overpass construction, but the skinny pass is more fun.After you make it past the overpass, you're going to find yourself in what is a large easement to a local neighborhood, used for creek maintenance and water management. You'll bike past a few backyards on the easement before finding yourself back in the woods on another singletrack. It's a cute little push, that with enough imagination you can make fun with. It will take you over one last wooden bridge, that sits atop a 5 foot (ish) drop to a running creek, and into another clearing with another overpass, this time for a more local road. But you'll bike under it as well, until you get to the picnic table.Now, here you have some options. Most local bikers stop here and then double back to the trail head, seeing the features from the other side, which really does make it feel entirely different. Others, will actually follow a simple path onto the local road where you can easily peddle some local sidewalks back to the trail head by way of the middle school. Or, you can continue on through a path known as the Rabbit Trail. During the summer though, it's usually pretty muddy, so it's not a well worn path by bikers. Usually just hikers, kind of spooky to.So, that's trail number one. The second trail by way of the entrance from the middle school, is all the way down the boardwalk / bridge, you'll go down some stairs to the right, but you'll immediately turn to your left. That's the start of the second trail. This trail doesn't have any major milestones, per say. Itcan get technical with some batches of tricky roots, and a few ups and downs, nothing heinous. You'll go over two wooden bridges on your way to the end of the trail where there's a small loop you can go around to double back down the trail.Honestly, it's a good work out, and like any local trail when you know the ins and outs you make the best of the things most others don't notice, like roots to pop up off, or banks to dive down, etc.That's it, Shingle Creek, simple, local and loved.",

    "description": "<p>by Dana Farnsworth, Outdoor Travels - Balm Boyette Scrub Preserve - the bastard stepchild that doesn't get the attention it deserves. No matter how wonderful the cross country riding, no matter how pretty the scenery, no matter how diverse the terrain and the trail personalities, Boyette seems doomed to live in the shadow of its more popular neighbor Alafia State Park.</p><p>One would think that Boyette offers little to the mountain bike rider, based on the limited traffic of knobby tires on any given weekend. After riding Balm Boyette off and on for a couple of years now, I can tell you that most riders have no idea what they are missing.</p><p>Boyette does itself no favors with its location. Once a phosphate mine, the area is somewhat hidden from any major road and can be hard to find. My first attempt ended in mad frustration when the directions in my guide book were incorrect!</p><p>What are you missing if you haven't ridden Boyette before? Well, first there is the 12 continuous mile Forested Loop Trail. Almost a separate entity from the rest of Boyette, this loop offers up a long and winding, uninterrupted stretch of oak and pine shaded single track that one can really stretch their legs on. As the trail winds back on itself over and over again, it's easy to fall into a hypnotic-like trance.</p><p>Boyette also features some of the best cross country type riding around. Miles of unobstructed single track weaves its way along the edges of lakes, through pretty and unique prarie-type fields (which are better explored in the non-summer months), and forested canopy with brilliant green ferns lining the trail. There are a couple of short climbs here and there as well as some nice intermediate level challenges.</p><!-- wp:paragraph --><p></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

Through efforts of the local NICA team and other volunteers, Bartram now boasts 7.5 miles of singletrack that has old school, hand built sections as well as machine built flow trails. With a new trail head kiosk, maps and waypoint markers throughout the network, these trails have now become accessible to anyone wanting to ride, run or hike the area. There are 3 marked loops now. The Green loop is 5.5 miles of pure beginner friendly (but not boring) trails. The Blue loop incorporates the trails from the Green loop and adds in the old school trails to bring the total mileage to 7.5 miles. The Red loop throws everything Bartram has to offer. It pieces together both singletrack sections in different ways from the Blue and Green loops, letting you ride the most fun segments in the direction they were built to flow the best and adds in some forest roads to incorporate more climbs and some fast downhills. There is also a connector trail now that leads over to Selma Erwin Nature Preserve Trails. Riding both trails in one loop gives about 20 miles and one heck of a workout.",

Through the hard work of the Ocmulgee Mountain Bike Association and Bibb County, the trail system has been redesigned and rebuilt. The new trail opened up 2 years ago (2011) and is better than ever! This is some of the most demanding singletrack in Middle Georgia with great climbs and fast downhills. The park also offers lake access and camping. There are two loops that are well marked, a Beginner loop as well as an Advanced loop. The Beginner loop takes out a couple of the longer climbs but it's still a challenging ride. To reach both trail heads you'll take the first paved road to your left once you enter the part, at the bottom of the hill you'll see the trail kiosk with the Advanced trail starting to the left of the bathrooms. To reach the Beginner trailhead you'll need to ride up the road a few hundred feet and you'll see the trailhead on your left. An additional 2 or so miles of trail to be built finished later this year!

Great mix of high mountain passes, great vistas, open sagebrush, forested singletrack, creek crossings, open meadows, and everything else you'd expect on a ride on the Boulder-White Clouds.",

The write up below describes a clockwise ride up Little Boulder Creek and down Big Boulder. Aside from the road between Big and Little Boulder Trailheads, the entire trail is singletrack and open to motorcycles. The climb up from Little Boulder Creek Trailhead starts steeply right away on good singletrack. Then becomes rocky and technical with some hiking involved. Further up the trail is forested and sweet. The section from the Chamberlain intersection to Frog Lake has some loose and rocky sections as well but is mostly ridable. From Frog Lake there is about 2 more miles of climbing before you reach a broad saddle and the trail begins descending. The singletrack descent is about 6 miles long and is full of berms and bridges. Lookout for hidden sharp turns after superfast sections. The upper descent is mostly pine duff and grippy. Toward the bottom some rocky sections keep you honest but are still not too technical. Big Boulder Trailhead is at the bottom of this descent. Take the road back to your car if you parked at East Fork or Little Boulder. Do this ride before the politicians make it wilderness!!",

It then descends into Deadman Canyon where it crosses Deadman Creek multiple times in the next several miles and drops precipitously along exposed and loose trail. At the bottom of Deadman Canyon, the trail follows Warm Springs Creek through a fairly wide drainage and crosses the creek on a large bridge about halfway down the canyon. This section of trail has both short climbs and descents. There is a significant climb of just over 2 miles as you leave the canyon bottom which turns into a narrow rocky gorge. As the trail climbs, it provides nice views of the creek in the gorge below. The climb is difficult if not impossible due to steep and loose trail conditions. The trail then intersects with the Link Trail. Turn left for the final downhill stretch to the trailhead at the Warm Spring Airstrip. Hang a right, go down the road, and then a left at the FS Guard Station. Finish by descending to highway 21, and then on to Bonneville hot springs.",

The two new sections north of the dam add a little elevation, particularly the newest (and as of 10/25/03 unfinished) section northeast of the dam. Highlights of the park include a series of ravines in Section 5; a number of logpiles in sections 6, 4, 3, \"Bovine Run\", and the new-new trail; a fast downhill/slow climb (depending on which way you go) on the new-new trail, and a floating bridge on the county trail. Comlara Off-Road Biking Association (CORBA) builds and maintains the trails; see our website (linked on this page) for more information about the club, more detailed descriptions of each section, and a few pictures of us building and riding the trails.",

    "description": "First trailhead (Lakeview side) beyond the closed gates down the paved road on the right about 100 ft past the gate. This will take you to the Valley run. Very fast and challenging trail with a few \"air\" opportunities. Quick turns and narrow wooden bridges are plenty so be on your toes. Watch out for Turtles. Follow the trail along the lake and you will find a split in the trail. 1) To the right you will find Heartbreak Hill. A challenging climb that will take you to the top of Lakeview into a winding trail that drops into Willemberg Hill. A fast terraced, hill that will test your descending skills. Across the bridge at the bottom, let off the brakes, catch some air and up the run off hill. Watch for riders and hikers on the cross path. 2) To the left you will drop to a swampy area and cross a long bridge then a short bridge that takes you to the most challenging climb out here. Many a rider has been humbled on this climb. Make it to the top and you will be rewarded with the many twisting snappy turns of the Orange and Green trails. (you are now in Woodyard park) These trails weave in and out of the ravines offering some technical switchbacks and long flowing speed sections that will keep you guessing and your heart rate up. Follow the Orange trail south and you will find a metal bridge at the bottom of a very technical but short descent. Cross the bridge, follow the rocky path along the lake to the main lake parking area. Continue along the road around the south side of the lake, past the spillway to the dam. Ride across the dam and you will find a wide flowing trail that takes you across a narrow land bridge. Past there the trail gets more advanced. Use caution. The trail is very narrow and off camber. This trail comes out at the bottom of the paved road, south of the Lakeview parking area. Other trailhead is straight south on the paved road, up the paved hill. This will take you to the ridgeline run. It is very fast but lots of roots will challenge you. This trail has a great flow to build the speed you will need to get up the rooty run to the south end. Half way down the ridgeline there is a trail to the right which will drop you down to the valley. The trails are very technical. Good descents and tough climbs. There is a main outer loop with a central trail running center of valley. Several other trails run down from the outer loop to the center trail for different options on routes to mix things up a bit and keep it fun. Have not got exact measure on distance of trails. Just an estimate.More trails are being added so come back often and check them out.",

After the intersection of #3 and #4, there are about 5 new bridges over creeks that are not technical, but have a lip on the front and some are back to back.

Since the time of the initial study in 2005, TREC has completed the first phase of its project, which opened nearly three miles of recreational trails for public use from U.S. 40 to West Evergreen Avenue and from that portion of the trail to Nazarene Church Road.

You'll see intense climbing sections and blazing fast descents among other challenges. But there is something for everyone on this system along its sixteen named and numbered trails. Trails are primarily named with a numbering system, although several have conventional names. And not all numbered trails connect together in numerical order. Here is the naming convention:<ul> <li>Trails: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</li> <li>Trails: 1a, 1b</li> <li>Trails: Haul Road, Heaven &amp; Hell, Session</li> <li>Trails: Kids Loop, Playground Loop</li></ul>The main trailhead is located at the intersection of Kickapoo Park Road and 1200 East Road (40.152197, -87.716228). Several amenities are available at this paved parking area. These include a shelter with tables and fire pit, trail map, trash can and a pit toilet. There are usually plenty of locals here who can answer your trail questions.One of the best features of these trails is that they are one-way. With the exception of Trail 1, Haul Road and Session, flow direction is more or less counter-clockwise. This reduces the potential for conflict and increases safety while riding. Trail posts, located at the head of each trail, identify the number or name and ride direction.The trails located at the northern end of the system tend to have more advanced features. You'll find Trails 7, 8, 10, Heaven &amp; Hell, and Playground Loop contain some of the most difficult features to conquer. Bailouts and connection trails are available. Use these to bypass trails or change the riding order of trails. Each visit can be a new experience by switching your sequence of trails.Families with young riders may want to check out the Kids Loop. Located at the main trailhead, this 500-foot trail is primarily flat, offering a great place for push bikes and younger riders.An outdoor outfitter is available in Kickapoo near Clear Lake and the western park entrance. If you are in need of a bike for the day, Kickapoo Adventures has mountain bikes for day or half-day rentals. Stop by and check out their inventory.For interactive maps, photos, and detailed trail descriptions, check out the <a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/aa2e3a41c3dc40fdb2aee1f3d0c2d058\">Danville City GIS application</a>.",

You can get to this trail either by taking the connector off the intermediate trail then turn right on Glenn Rd. then left on Trailer Court Rd to Schoen Creek trail. Parts of this trail are built into the sides of hills and have pretty good drop-offs. The trail system is very well maintained and would be a great afterwork ride. Total time for all three trails is about 1 hour. There are three trailheads and all are highlighted on the maps that you can pick up at the park entrance. I rode aprox 9.25 miles which includes the road riding from one trail to another.",

    "description": "These trails have received a great deal of care and hard work over the past few years and have made it into one of the most technical trails in Indiana. There are numerous bridges, teeter totters, log crossings, skinnies, and a couple drops all included in the expert trail. The park is owned by he city of Anderson, but a logal group of guys have put in the hours to turn this into a gem. Tight, twisty and technical single track is at Rangeline Nature Preserve. RNP has 3 loops; Novice, Intermediate, and Expert. Novice is smooth, fast, and flowing. Intermediate is narrow with a few natural obstacles. Expert is tighter, slower, and loaded with obtacles such as suspension bridge, elevated trail, gap jump, teeter totter, etc. Many more obstacles and trail modifications are in the works. All trails are single track. Novice = 2 miles Intermediate = 3 miles Expert = 6 miles The trails are very easy to follow and marked with arrows. Direction is one way so please do not ride backwards (follow the arrows). All trails start and end at the same location at the message board which is located at the West end of the parking lot in the skills area. See Google Maps directions above.",

    "description": "This trail is a public trail on private property. There is no fee but a waiver is required (available at the trailhead). This is an out and back trail totaling 6 miles of singletrack trail. This is an intermediate trail with side loops that are for advanced riders. It contains whoop-de-dos, roller coasters, benched areas, rocks, bridges, switchbacks, ramps, and other technical features. It is not for beginners but intermediate riders should have few problems if the advanced sections are avoided. Beware of the Wooden whoop-de-do and the Plunges if you don't have the skill to ride them. At the bottom of the State Street trail go right (uphill) on Valley Street .1 mi to the Valley Street section. The State St. section is more technical than the Valley St. section. To get 6 miles in such a small area requires a tight trail and good bike handling skills are necessary, but the trail flows nicely and there are stretches where speed can be attained. Signage makes the trail easy to follow if you pay attention, and it is well maintained during the prime riding season. There is a fair amount of climbing to get back to the top of State St. This is a mountain bike trail only and foot traffic is not allowed.

    "description": "Fast riding flowing singletrack with some rocks, roots and climbs to keep you on your toes. Its lighter sandy soil allows for riding sooner after a rain without damaging the trail. The latter part of May into June brings an awe inspiring carpet of bluebells in the Bottoms segment. An occasional bald eagle can be seen, as well as many deer and turkeys. It is not uncommon to hear owls hooting and woodpeckers pecking.Need To KnowNo bathrooms or running water at the trailhead. There is a convenience store a few miles away. The trail is probably ridden equally each direction. I chose to map it going counter-clockwise. Either direction you'll encounter some short and somewhat rocky and or rooty climbs. The trail is one basic loop with a few spurs. As a general rule going in the counter-clockwise direction, each time there is a \"Y\" in the trail go to the right and you won't miss any of the spurs. Most of the spurs return to within 10-25 yards of where they spurred off so you can shorten your route if desired. Eagle Lodge Loop (0.25 mile segment)is the first spur. It skirts behind a few houses and Eagle Lodge. This loop and the Bottoms Loop tend to be the wettest segments so keep that in mind if there has been a recent rain. The Numbers (1.5 miles segment) spurs off about 1 mile on down the trail. It has some tighter turns, but still keeps with the fast flowy style of Ingawanis Woodlands. Karmondo (0.75 mile segment) starts at the Numbers' exit and takes you quickly down to somewhat lower ground. Near the water's edge is a \"Y\" where keeping to the right again takes you up the challenging but scenic climb of El Capitan (0.25 mile segment) with its rocky outcroppings and pretty east facing overlook. Would be a nice spot to pull up a rock or stump and sip some early morning coffee and watch the sunrise. From the top, the trail drops down quickly to join Karmondo again. Karmondo winds uphill with some gradual switchbacks and seamlessly joins the main loop. At this point, the trail picks up some speed with a bit more open turns. Use caution through here as the bottom of the curves tend to collect sand and there are a few areas of erosion. [As a side note - the goal is to correct any of these older unsustainable trail pieces.] In about 1 mile is the Bottoms (1.0 mile segment). This spur runs through the flood plain. Although it is basically flat through here, there are a couple opportunities to catch some air if you play it right. Late May into June the trail winds through an awe inspiring sea of Bluebells (as long as there is not considerable flooding). When the Bottoms are flooded go left at the \"Y\" to follow the Highwater Cutoff for about 50 yards and continue on the main loop. Once you exit the Bottoms about 2 miles of trail remains. However, in those 2 miles are 2 climbs that will get your attention again. One is a bit rocky and loose. The other is quite rocky and rooty. Clearing the rocky rooty segment warrants a fist pump or high-five! Sail through the next half mile and you are back at the parking lot.",

    "description": "The mountain bike trail is a clockwise stacked loop system. It begins at the trailhead (go left at kiosk) in Switchgrass Campground with the Golden Belt Loop (aka, gold), then the Marina Loop (aka, purple), and finally the Hell Creek Loop (aka, red). If you wanted to ride all the loops in order, you’d ride Gold – Purple – Red – Purple – Gold. Begin at the trailhead on the Gold, then intersect with the Purple, then ride the Red. After completing the Red, you get back on the Purple. Completing that, you are back on the Gold. That’s about 22 miles all of which is great singletrack. If needed, the trail is never far from a bailout to a paved road back to the trailhead. Plan on 2-4 hrs depending on biking skill and how much sightseeing you might want to do. The loop record for racing is 1:40. The novice level (EZ) loop is a 2-mi clockwise loop or 5-mi if you add the optional Bird Loop. EZ also starts and ends at the Switchgrass trailhead (go right at kiosk). It is non-technical with no climbs, no deep sand, and very few rocks. It is about a 20-40 minute ride suitable for beginners. But, EZ is a genuine mountain bike trail, so don’t expect a paved path! Runners and hikers, if you want to try an awesome 3-mile section, start under the west end of the Hell Creek bridge, and do the Hell Creek loop. Any of the remainder of the trail system is also great for running or hiking. Just remember that bikes go clockwise and foot traffic goes counterclockwise. Watch out for trail user traffic, and be very cautious making the 4 pavement crossings within the park. This trail has some technically difficult sections in all the loops (except EZ). Most of the trail is moderate to easy, but there are several rocky sections, deep sand, arduous climbs, highly exposed ledges, and steep drops. On average, the trail is rated blue (intermediate riders), but there are black (expert only) sections interspersed, and an ample amount of green (any rider). The trail is open year-around, spring and fall are best, but there are many great days for riding in the winter and early mornings are spectacular for riding in the summer months. Many sections of the trail are very close to the lake shore, which can make for a refreshing stop during the summer. There is no drinking water or restroom on the trail, except at the Trailhead. All park restrooms have showers, but are closed October-March. Cell phone coverage is about 75%. Short cutting the trail will almost certainly result in exposure to poison ivy, which can cause an allergic reaction even in winter. If you stay on the trail, you need not worry about poison ivy. Pets are allowed on the trail but must be under control at all times. If you encounter a maintenance issue on the trail that needs attention, please call the trail coordinator. If you want to observe natural beauty amongst the rust-colored Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone cliffs and outcrops, this trail is the place. The park was created from former grazing land and on this trail you’ll see many limestone fence posts that are historical remnants of the early ranching era of this land. Furthermore, private land just outside the park is still actively used for cattle ranching. Southshore Drive meanders through spectacularly scenic native rangeland and a favorite of local motorcycle tourists. Watch out for wildlife in the summer, particularly herptiles on the trail – the ornate box turtle, horned lizard, racerunner, skink, legless lizard, collared lizard, and several species of snakes are all common during warm weather. Rattlesnakes are present in the park, most are a petite species known as the massasauga or pigmy rattler. It is unlawful to harass, kill, or injure wildlife in the park. Take care not to run over any critters on the trail. You might also see wild turkey, deer, bobwhite quail, pheasant, red-tailed hawk, and many species of grassland songbirds such as larks and sparrows. The wildflowers and grasses are a spectacular part of the park’s natural landscape. Every season is different. Wildflowers show a constant progression of colors from early spring to late fall. Winter colors are vibrant rusts, browns, and golds set against the blue water of the lake. The Switchgrass Trail is named after a native prairie grass that is common throughout the central and eastern plains. Switchgrass grows abundantly in the park and has gained national attention as a prospective source of cellulosic ethanol. The best source of info on the trail is http://www.facebook.com/switchgrasstrail",

    "description": "One review on another site says this is \"...definitely the best (trail) west of Perry Lake and all the way to Colorado...\". It is honest-to-goodness technical singletrack that one would not generally expect to find in Kansas. As a Colorado native and resident I was reminded of home on several portions of this trail; switchbacks, loose rocky descents, quick abrupt climbs, rock gardens, ledges, and multiple water crossings. The trail offers something for everyone from Beginner to Advanced.Recommend taking the \"north\" trailhead from the parking lot (eg: heading counterclockwise along the loop). One will jog through a dense and twisty cedar forest which eventually gives way to lush green \"valleys\" and water crossings in the lower lying areas. Expect some mud, rock gardens, and tall ledges. At about 4 miles you will climb a loose rocky section that takes you up to the surrounding plateau with great views of Tuttle Reservoir to the east. Descend back down through some more forest and come out at the other end of the parking lot. Along the trail you'll see markers indicating distance. Though rare, depending on trail maintenance, the lower areas may be covered by high grass and growth making it difficult to see the trail in spots. At roughly midpoint the trail branches, choose left to stay on the loop. The trail also crosses the narrow road leading to/from the Fancy Creek Campground in two spots. Watch for cars and drivers not used to seeing bikers. Also, might be wise to check for ticks after the ride based on personal experience...",

Air Cap is an official city park owned by the City of Wichita and located north of, and separate from, Pawnee Prairie Park. Helmets are required at all times. Even though this is a MTB trail, watch for walkers and runners on the trail.The North loop is a beginner level trail that toys with the sides of an abandoned railroad bed with fun, but small climbs and descents.The West loop is an intermediate level trail that is mostly flat with a few short climbs and descents near the railroad bed. It has good flow through the trees and a few rock and log obstacles.The East loop is an Advanced level trail that is mostly a rock garden, which in Wichita means old piles of concrete and asphalt debris. However, this trail will challenge you and get your heart pumping with its many short steep climbs and rocky terrain. The trail is good practice for us flat-landers to build confidence, technique and prepare for rockier trails in other areas of the state and nation.String all three of these trails together for a fun and varied ride.Riders are warned that Pawnee Prairie Park (south of Air Cap) is closed to bikes and riding there is punishable by law.This trail is maintained by Kansas Singletrack Society.

The trail takes you to the other side of HWY99 to a nice leg of the trail. You will wind around and end up back at HWY99. The trail will take you back to the main side. Take the trail to the right. This part of the trail runs along HWY99 and has some Technical challenges. You will come to another single gate. Take the trail to the left. This leeds you to the center of the trail, where big slabs of concrete were dumped. You will hit some BMX style trail and wind through the concrete forest. There are some nice technical challenges along this part of the trail. Now you will head back to the woods. Along this part of the trail there are alot of technical turns, climbs, and descents. You will wind aound a bit before getting back to the second gate. Now at the second gate take the trail to the left. This will take you through the open field and back to the beginning. There is another leg just behind the ball diamond. Follow the road along the river it will lead you right to the trail. This is a nice fast short trail.

Future plans are to connect both trails once funds are available to design and install a bridge. This trail has been a 4 year project and KSS is working with the land manager for upgraded signage. More bike traffic means more money for the park service and helps us ask for more signage, upgrades, and the possibly of opening land on the west side of the lake as an additional trail. Please consider a yearly pass if you plan to ride often. The trail is currently 1.8 miles with good elevation changes, tight turns, and plenty of rocks. The trail is completely new and is maintained by Kansas Singletrack Society. Plans are to double the trail length in late 2015. Open from sunrise to sunset only.

Although there are no major obstacles or serious challenges to Millers, it is fast in many sections and proves to be hazardous to even experienced riders that might have a lapse of situational awareness. The trail runs opposite directions on certain days. Runners always run against the bike direction. Helmets are required at all times at the property owner's request. Millers Meadow is also the site of many events, such as the annual Millers Meadow Monster Mash (M4) ride that is 20 laps, or 100 miles, long. Visit M4ride.blogspot.com for more information.

I prefer the Orange trail and the Blue is great for a longer, more technical ride. My only complaint is that the trails are shared with Equestrians, so there is one sections where the trails all come back together near the trailhead which is basically a dirt road through a prairie and if it's rained recently, the horse tracks will beat you to death. Hang to the edges and you can ride it out. ;)",

    "description": "difficulty: Advanced. Best trail in southern LA. It is hard.. that is why it is called the Beast. Big climbs, they never stop... the whole trails is a massive climb, some of the drops are very fun. You need technical skills. The downhills curve and go over trees, bridges, roots. You will have an awesome time...This trail was begun but unfinished by the same bloke who did the great trail system in Ruston, LA (Lincoln Parish Park), James Ramsaur. It was completely destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav. Beginning again in 2008, Lynn Gray, with the help of friends, designed, rebuilt, and completed a 6 mile loop with 16 bridges, bench cuts, and other new features. The trail ducks in and out of the woods surrounding the park. 95% twisting technical wooded singletrack. A couple short sections of double track. Many twisting, steep rooty off-camber hills. Good elevation change for Louisiana. Great semi-technical downhills. Trail is decently marked and follows a single loop.",

    "description": "OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven. Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads. The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs. Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control. Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules. Overall, I rate this network a 10. Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops. Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain. Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park). Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc. These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'. Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours. Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline. Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.",

Get warmed up before you start. Once you get up to the left side of the resort the trail levels off and gets more windy with fewer rocks and is a lot of fun. after about a mile of that it starts decending again criss-crossing the mountain sidefor a fun fast ride back down to the bottom. Because of the harsh begining it feels like a lot longer than the 3-4 miles it is said to be. Stop in at Maine Sport on Route 1 for a map. Also, I haer that this course is a NORBA race course, so look out for some trail markers on the trail. ",

From there, you will cross a small stream. Continue straight. You will see the entrance to the single track on the right. It is a pretty sharp uphill turn. There is no trail map so exploring is the key. The \"Bucket trail\" is a must ride. Fun, flowing, and twisty. Look for the metal bucket hanging from a tree.

The park is indeed a VALLEY.The Patapsco River cuts through Maryland and at the Avalon Area,creates a steep walled Valley.Perfect for short but treacherous single track riding. Some of the best single track on the East Coast is found here. You take a 1/2 mile downhill ride across streambeds and all singletrack.Then you can take any number of trails back to the top of the valley.Chances are you won't be back at the Park &amp; ride. The trail system is over twenty miles in this section of Pa Taps Co alone. This description doesn't cover the McKinley Area or Hilton Area of Patapsco. Use caution on these trail systems and try not to ride alone.It's more fun with a group any way.Always take spare tubes and chain breakers. If you get stuck in this area of the park,You will have a tough time getting back. Always stay on the trails and treat the area with utmost respect. This is a river valley and we all know about erosion don't we?The trails in Avalon are some very technical trails. If you are new to MTB,please ride with a friend or be very careful.If you are an experienced rider,the challenges are endless.We have been riding Patapsco for twenty years and never tire of it's variety of trails and natural beauty.",

    "description": "The 7.9-mile one-way Fort Circle Trail is the only singletrack trail in the District on which mountain biking is permitted. There are quite a few street crossings, including some busy ones, but you probably wonít mind the brief rest once you see how many hills this trail has in store. Its main drawback is how overgrown with vegetation it can get. The center section of the trail from Ridge Road south to Good Hope Road is very nicely wooded and hilly singletrack. South of Good Hope Road, the trail becomes extremely overgrown with plants by the time it enters Fort Stanton Park. North of Ridge Road it is overgrown in some places (though still rideable) and very urban in others.From the parking lot, take the asphalt path downhill (away from Fort Dupont Drive) and take the first right to continue on asphalt across an open grassy area. The trail soon enters the woods and becomes gravel. It will turn to asphalt again shortly before it comes to a T with another path. Turn right at the T to arrive at the intersection of Ridge Rd and Fort Davis Drive. Cross Fort Davis Drive at the intersection, because you pick up the dirt singletrack Fort Circle Trail at the corner, where it enters the woods. Ride through the hills of Fort Dupont Park until you come to a T. Turn right and you will come immediately to another trail junction. You can go either way here. If you go right you will ride along the bottom of a hill. If you go straight, you will go up this very tough hill to a grass clearing, then turn right to re-enter the woods and bomb down the other side of the hill (makes it worth the effort!) to link up with the main trail again. Continue to follow the trail south through the woods with street crossings at Massachusetts Avenue, Fort Davis Drive, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Branch Avenue. After crossing Branch Avenue, ride up Park Drive a short way to where the trail re-enters the woods on the right. This next section is very hilly. When you reach 28th Street, cross and go left a short way until the trail again enters the woods. There are two more street crossings, at Naylor Road and Good Hope Road. Across Good Hope Road the trail crosses several small bridges and a muddy area on its way to Fort Stanton Park. It will likely become too overgrown to continue somewhere in this area, where you must turn around and return all the way to the intersection of Ridge Road and Fort Davis Drive. Cross this intersection to the trail entrance diagonally opposite you and follow the trail until you hit C Street. Cross and continue to a trail junction where you go right and eventually cross East Capitol Street. After crossing, go up a grassy hill, ride the trail down to Flint Place, and continue a short way to Benning Road. Cross and take the concrete path to the left a short way, then right up a hill and follow the loop around through the park until you return to Benning Road. Return a second time to the intersection of Ridge Road and Fort Davis Drive, this time going back down the paved trail to the right through Fort Dupont Park and to the parking lot where you started.",

Because it is such a popular family area, it's not a great idea for advanced riders to come to Great Brook to do their serious weekend pounding. It's wise for fast riders to avoid this park on nice summer weekends. It certainly is a good idea to avoid riding hard on the main trails. The main trails are frequented by family groups of four of five people, both hikers and bikers, including young kids, often on little bikes. Some of the more out-of-the-way single-tracks offer more challenge without this risk over running over slower bikers.",

It is very nice and have plumbing. There are also picnic tables in the same area. Sooner or later there will be horses. They may have their own trail they may not. I did ride the other loops and did not get into trouble, however again there is only one bike trail. The trails are mark pretty good. Though a couple of times on my own I had to double back. There are trails at the trail head, and there are many post to identify where you are at. The Green trail is by far the hardest. The Blue and Red are short and the Yellow is the longest. Though keep in mind, nothing is that long. About three miles is the longest trail. There is a lot of wildlife in the area. There are a lot of other trails in the area other than the bike path, and colored paths, these are not allowed. This would be a great ride for beginners or maybe an introduce others into mountain biking. Take your camera.",

    "description": "The Big Snowy mountains don't look like much from a distance, but once in them, they quickly become quite rugged, steep, and beautiful. To start the ride, go back down to the campground and take the trail that heads off to the right by the bathroom. After you descend a bit on the well maintained trail, it will become true singletrack next to the lake. Take the fork that branches uphill from the lake (Grandview Trail). There also be a cutback marked as a horse cutoff and the way back to the Uhlhorn trail--Ignore it. The climb is gradual at first with level portions where you can recover. THe higher you go, the steeper and more consistent it gets. At the lower elevations, the trail is sweet, forest singletrack with enough rocks and roots to keep it entertaining. It is also surprisingly lush here, As you climb higher, parts are covered with deep, loose shale, making the climbing even more difficult. At about 3.5 miles, look for the spur trail to Grandview point--it's worth the short trip for the fantastic view. After you rejoin the main trail, it gets really steep. A little over 4 miles, there is a short downhill, followed by another brutal climb. Some very tight, steep switchbacks will force dismounts. At about six miles, you will see a sign for the Dry Pole trail, but there doesn't seem to be any trail there--just keep on straight. After another .4 mile, there will be some very rough going that will cause a portage--i'ts steep, loose, and there is some exposure, making carrying your bike a littly sporty. After you carry your bike back up to the ridge, it's all gravy. The first great thing is the spur trail (hiking only) to the ice cave. Stash the bike and head down the spur for about .3 mi. It's an easy climb down into the cave and, even in August, there may be a column of ice from ceiling to floor (see pics)! It's well worth the extra effort. After you climb back up to the ridge, you'll follow the ridge top, navigating by cairn as the trail disappears completely). Take time to admire the views. To the northeast are the Judith Mountains, the Mocassin Mountains to the North, the Highwoods to the Northwest, and the Little Belts to the West. On a clear day, you can even see the Crazy Mountains to the Southwest. At about 8 miles, the ridge trail heads right and the Uhlhorn trail, your big payoff, continues more or less straight. After a little more ridgetop riding and some bobbing and weaving throu the hardy pines that inhabit this rugged environment, you'll begin one of the finest descents anywhere on the planet--I defy you not to hoot n' holler with joy (if you're an advanced rider--it's challenging in places). You'll descend 2200 feet in just three miles, including over 1700 in less than the first two. Up high, you'll have to surf some loose shale, but when you ge to the middle portion, you'll be on the best singletrack imaginable--narrow, steep, tremendous flow and a few opportunities for some air. The bottom third is less steep and punctuated with lots of roots and small drainage cuts across the trail--be ready to get light on your feet. There are a couple tight switchbacks and some deadfall that will check your speed. Although only 12 miles, this could have easily been categorized as \"epic\" and the climb up from the lake definitely makes it worthy of \"tough climbs\" status. But it's this absolutely rockin' descent that really stands out--it more than justifies the pain of the climb. What a treasure in someplace you wouldn't even think of looking--worth a trip from just about anywhere!",

The Judith Mountains don't look like much from a distance, but the BLM has built a killer trail here with stiff climbs, great views, and sweet singletrack. To begin, follow the trail from the sign until it meets a road. DO NOT cross the road as you will soon meet a dead end. Instead, follow the road through a large gate. Be respectful of the easement through private property. Shortly after going through the gate, look for the singletrack on the left. Youve got a great climb for the first mile and a half. Then it's decision time--I suggest taking the spur to the Lewistown overlook. It's more climbing and the view may or may not be worth it to you, but the downhill return is screaming good fun. After you rejoin the main loop, there will be some more climbing before some wonderful, pine needle covered narrow and twisty. Some more climbing takes you to a ridge followed by another screaming descent and some very cool switchbacks back to your car.

Also on the plus side, however are some great views and absolutely no traffic of any type. The most maddening feature is the map on the BLM web site and on the sign at the trailhead indicates a loop of which I found none. In fact, I spent hours wandering the woods looking for a trailhead that doesn't exist on the south end--it's supposted to be the stem of a lollipop loop.

It went to the top of Collar Peak, much of which was unrideable for all but the superhuman, and ended there with no way to complete the loop.",

You'll know you've reached the top when you see the forest service lookout tower. If it's open, you can go up the stairs and take in the views. Then go back down to your bike and look for the singletrack (Mitzpah Ridge Trail 780) heading into the woods just south of the tower. There are plenty of opportunites to get lost here--just keep looking for the blue diamonds on the trees. The trail will alternate between woods and meadows with occasional views. There are a couple steep, rooty drops that can be a lot of fun. After you've descended most of the way, there are a few false singletracks and a number of doubletracks that can lead you astray--no worries, just keep heading south and you'll eventually end up on highway 89. Then you begin the climb back up Kings Hill Pass from the south. If you want to avoid seven miles of sloggin up boring pavement, leave a shuttle car at the bottom. Our exit point didn't match where we left the shuttle, so we had to do some scouting along the highway to figure out which way to turn to reach it. The Forest Service has a pamphlet with the Mountain Biking Trails in the Lewis and Clark National Forest that is somewhat helpful, although it lacks detail. The USGS quads for the area are seriously out of date and don't show many of the trails/doubletracks.",

    "description": "The first three miles climb at a moderate grade with many stream crossings--you will get wet--some like to save this ride for later in the summer when the water is lower. After three miles, the grade steepens--now you're really working. The trail will veer right (south). At this point, look left and back up the hill for the Kirby Creek Trail. Follow it 0.2 miles and turn left (uphill) on the Marie Spring Trail. The grade will be tough, then drop quickly to a saddle, and then climb steeply again up the other side. Now, you're getting your first reward as you get panoramic views of the Highwoods Mountains and glimpses of the endless prairie beyond. At 4.7 mi. you'll pass by the White Wolf Trail on your left--keep going straight. At 5.7 mi. you'll pass by the Briggs Creek Trail on your left. This can provide a quick way back if you're tired. Although you've passed your maximum altitude for the ride, there are still countless short but steep climbs remaining that will require lots of energy. If you're up to it, continue straight on the Windy Mountain trail for your next big climb. After the climb, get ready for a great roller coaster section in dark woods--very cool. There are many blind curves--one is followed by a sharp, technical drop into a small gully--an endo waiting to happen if you're not ready--great fun if you've got the reflexes for it. Press on through what seems like way to many climbs as you traverse the south flank of Windy Mountain. There will be a dry, dusty, south facing drop from Windy Mountain to the head of Thain Creek--then the real fun begins. Once in the woods again, there is absolutely screaming downhill--hang on for a very fast, fun ride. Shortly after the downhill abates, you'll come to a gate. Go through the gate to a road and follow the road to the right until it hits the road you'll tale left, back to your car. This ride seems much tougher and longer than the distance or elevation profile would indicate.",

    "description": "This is a less-traveled route that gives you a different view of the Highwoods. There is less climbing than the Windy Mountain route, but the downhill isn't quite as much fun either. Start as you would on the Windy Mountain loop, heading up the North Fork of Highwood Creek. At 2.8 miles, look for the Center Ridge Trail 415 (may be hard to spot) on the right. Follow it up from the drainage. After about half a mile, you will have to go right--you may notice a trail heading left, but that will take you far from where you want to be. After some level riding, there will be a nice drop into a drainage and a climb up to a saddle, followed by some gentle roller coaster riding. About a half mile after the saddle, the trail will veer right (northeast, and you'll follow ridge that runs roughly parallel to the North Fork Highwood creek you started out on. A few miles of ridgetop riding with great views brings you to a screaming downhill off the ridge that will deposit you very close to your car. The USGS Arrow Peak quad is very helpful for this ride. If you don't want to worry about getting lost, ride the loop in reverse, but that will involve some brutal climbing.",

The first part of the climb has a moderate grade, but the last half is brutal and unrelenting. Be in shape or shuttle it--if I ever do this one again, I will. As a shuttle, I'd give this four stars. Climb up the Logging Creek road for 7 or so miles and head left when the road meets Divide Road (the sign will indicate you are going toward White Sulphur Springs. Continue another 9 or so miles, past numerous trails. When you see a sign on your left that says Deer Park, you're getting close. A few more curves and you will see a sign indicating Pilgrim Creek to your left. The singletrack starts off extremely rough--long fields of baby heads, both loose and embedded. Then the trail begins its desdent. It gets crazy steem in places--hang your b*** off the back or go over the bars. There will be many drainage crossings with technical entry/exits. You will also cross Pilgrim Creek numerous times. , not always rideabe, so you will get wet.

    "description": "The name itself is a challenge to the die-hard mountain biker, and the reality doesn’t disappoint. The Bloody Shins Trail, the first developed in the Winnemucca Mountain Bike Trail System, runs seven to seventeen arduous miles. The trailhead can be found right on the edge of town, which is supremely convenient for residents and visitors alike. The track is divided into beginner, intermediate and advanced grades, all of which are clearly marked, so novice riders shouldn’t be scared off. The surfaces of each loop on the trail are comprised of dirt roads, two tracks and single tracks, and mini cattleguards have been installed, so there’s no need for bikers to open or close gates. The beginner trail starts at an elevation of 4,570 feet and tops out at 4,820 feet after a fairly easy but certainly enjoyable ride. The intermediate 12-mile track rises 1,000 feet and won’t be forgotten quickly. But it’s the advanced loop that will really appeal to the adrenaline junkie. The 17-mile round trip ascends to an elevation of 5,200 feet. On all loops, the views are phenomenal and the rides themselves truly memorable. Although the Bloody Shins Trail is a mountain biker’s paradise, other non- motorized activities are welcome. Outdoor lovers should feel free to hike or horseback ride across the beautiful terrain. The views of the valley floor and surrounding mountain ranges won’t disappoint and stealthy visitors may be fortunate enough to spot native wildlife. But to experience the Bloody Shins Trail as it was intended, throw on your helmet, get on your bike and get ready to taste a little Nevada dirt.",

    "description": "Alright, so the first trail on the right leads to this small dirt bowl with some smaller jumps (big enough for me) where you can have some fun. In the middle of the bowl, if you take a left, you'll hit some of the fastest single track in the Gyro, which has wider turns, is mostly flat, and with some nice dips here and there. Also a long 2 x 4 that clears a gap you can skip if you're not comfortable with it. Follow the track and it will come out close to the river (this is also where one of the other trails connects, so be on the lookout for other bikers). Take the track along the lake and continue on (you'll see some smaller dirt jumps), ride over the see-saw, and you'll be out of the system and amidst some small houses. You're back out on the road. Take a right, and you can go back to the gas station. The second trailhead on the right begins the twistier single track where you'll have to watch your handlebars and weasel through some tighter spots. This track is the longest, goes all over the place, comes out close to the river, but then turns back into the woods. The trail will pass through a clearing and end up where that first trail comes out. You can either continue on toward the river and finish out on the road, or you can turn on the faster single track and end your trip with the dirt bowl and come back out on the dirt service road. The trail on the left is not very twisty, it's quite short (fun too), and will pass by an impressive BMX/DJ section, before coming out in the parking lot of the first gas station you had earlier passed. Try to turn it all into a big loop! Optional: If you want, keep taking that dirt service road back, go over an old bridge with holes in it, and into a field. Best in the springtime when the grass is lower, but still very Little House on the Prairie any time of year. If you see ATV/bike tracks, follow them and watch out for animal dwellings. This leads (hopefully) to gravel road that you climb to a paved road. Take a left, go down the road, take another left onto the next road (175), and ride back into Plymouth. ",

    "description": "Let me start off by saying I wish someone would GPS this trail. You can get lost in Fox Park quite easily (I do all the time), so give yourself a big window of time. Also, please don't pay too much attention to the trail length I gave. I honestly can't tell you how far back this goes. This place has a good bit of variety, but it is mostly rocky/root-y single track that you'll be crawling up or flying down. There are some features mixed into the trails. A large 15+ foot log with the top hacked flat crosses a stream, a rather arbitrary boardwalk which reaches about 10 feet tall x 30 feet long you can ride down through the pine trees, and a dirt jump section which includes a few smaller jumps, an inclined log, some random log I think you're supposed to hop onto, and the coolest thing, a 3 foot high jump which throws you onto a steep decline at the bottom of which begins a 20 foot boardwalk/ramp that ends with a 6 - 7 foot gap. I ate dirt my first and only time, and my shin's still numb from where I banged it on the ground. So, Fox Park definitely has some cool stuff and it needs to really be explored! A lot of stream crossings could be cause for some more bridges, because I find myself walking across more than riding through. The best strategy, I think, is to climb to the highest point you can, which inevitably leads to the dirt jump section ... maybe. Honestly, someone needs to map that place. It's also a place where some swamp walks could be a huuuuuuuuuuge benefit. Anybody looking to develop a trail, check out Fox Park!",

    "description": "This is a network of doubletrack and singletrack trails. Some areas can be technical with some rocks and roots. Semi steep gradients in those areas where you have many choices on which direction you'd like to tackle the hill. Most have a way to get around the top without having to go down. You have to keep an eye out for the single track areas where people have made trails with whips and twists that have a nice flow. They are typically off the sides of the main trails. There are plenty of roots throughout and some fallen branches / logs that can be obstacles to climb over but most also have a way around. There are many trails running through this section of woods and most will lead out to Rancocas Blvd or Beach St. There are some areas where the trails are sandy but easily managed. There are also a few steep drop offs (20 ft) that you need to be mindful of when on some of the singletrack paths.",

    "description": "Rancocas State forest is split into three areas separated by the Rancocas Creek. One area is in Mount Laurel, one in Hainesport, and the third (best area imho) in Westampton. The site is not being completely cooperative and even trying to get help from admins has proven ineffective. The problem is the whole park is split among three towns and those three sections are separate of each other with a impassable creek between them. The best trail system in my opinion are those found in Westampton. This site defaults to showing GPS data for Hainesport. Bring up the Westampton GPS data for a decent loop through various colored trails. The pictures show the map for the Westampton trail system as well. The trail system is comprised of mostly singletrack. You'll find some downed logs to jump or ride over. Plenty of root covered paths. Most of the trails are perfectly clear while others are a little overgrown. The green trail has a Strava segment which is fun to blast through. It can be found by following the singletrack path to the right of the main gate on Powhatan Drive. When the path splits, stay to the right. The paths are easily identifiable by painted markings on the trees. If nature is your thing you'll come across plenty of squirrels, deer, streams, clearings, wild flowers, and views of the creek. I'd definitely rate these trails as beginner to intermediate depending on how fast you want to rip through them.",

    "description": "This trail system is composed of trails wide enough for vehicles (prohibited) and plenty of singletrack as you get closer to the creek. The trails are marked in colors on the trees. I typically enter at Deacon Rd. and go straight. This is the \"blue\" trail. I follow it till it branches off to the right by the water into singletrack. There are plenty of roots, some twists, and some hills. As you follow the path you'll come to two old log cabin ruins. Passing through here you'll eventually come to the area where the gravel road for Rancocas Rd. ends. If you keep going straight you'll see the blue markings on the trees to keep on that trail. After a bit of biking you'll have the choice of turning left or going straight. I normally go straight and continue on with the \"orange\" trail. This wraps around the woods on some doubletrack and eventually intersects back with the gravel road. You can go straight across here and pick up the \"green\" trail. This trail is all singletrack and you come to a pretty steep hill initially. After climbing the hill you'll end up following along a ridge then back to some more \"blue\" trail. There's a lot to this network of trails that I haven't mapped yet so stay tuned for more. One thing to be wary of, the sand. There are a few sandy areas which are easy to get through or go around however there are a couple hills where the bottoms can be a slight turn and sandy at times, both of which add to a possible front tire sliding out. Most of these trails are beginner with maybe a few intermediate areas.",

    "description": "This trail does not have much in the lines of elevation changes with the exception of a few places. It's a smooth, well maintained, and wide trail. You'll often find people walking and a few others on bikes. There are a few scenic spots where you can view a small creek and a long floating bridge that crosses a lake. I typically park on East Railroad Ave and hop on the red marked trail near the park. The trail is marked out well with red squares painted on trees or posts. You'll come to a descending stairway that you can attempt to ride down or to the left side there is enough room to just ride down next to it. You'll cross a few little bridges and it's mostly smooth. Nothing technical. You'll eventually reach Smithville Rd which you cross and continue to follow onto the green marked trail. That takes you to the lake with the long bridge. On the other side of that bridge are a couple staircases. You can go right and ride a small loop for their green trail (not shown on map) or head left and follow back to Smithville Rd. Smooth riding down their yellow marked trail which leads back to the parking lot on East Railroad Ave. I will mention that near the first descending staircase I described you'll see to the right a gazebo. If you ride in that direction and go through the gazebo, there is a singletrack that winds through the trees. Following that path will eventually lead you either back to the descending staircase or you can see another offshoot trail that heads down a hill with a couple little whips at the bottom. Nothing difficult. It's a nice little place to do laps for beginner fitness. Carrying the bike up and down the staircases adds to the cardio aspect. This trail system is definitely for beginners.",

After a while it turns into a more noticeable 4x4 trail, and since it borders some farm land, an ATV was spotted down the trail briefly. If you stay on the trail and not head off the trails on the right, the trail is actually about 3 miles long to Highway 167. I stopped there and went back, however beyond 167, the trail continues. It is a nice ride to just go after work. If you want to, on the way back, halfway down the street between Lock 18 and 5s, you will notice another trail.

The Glacier Trail is labeled \"intermediate\", along with the Link Trail, which puts you on the Great Trail, having a few more trail systems off of that as well. The Intermediate trails are more ups and downs, and some run back and forth under power lines. All trails are mostly double-track, with a few single-track sections, however the trail sections by the power lines are more of ATV trails. ",

I recommend this, since this lower parking lot is probably the lowest point in the state land. Now if you want a good burn, park and ride. However, driving up the hill and going about a mile on the truck trail you'll reach a jct with another truck trail. I tend to park there. It is in the center of the state land. You can choose any of the trails and loops. There is a few nice down hills but many trails are for cross country skiing so they are relatively flat. The grass grows rather high on some of the trails making it a pain. There are other trails in the woods with a better riding surface. If you want to stay the night, there is even a lean-to on the land, camp and make a wknd out of it.",

One starts/ends off the main rd. across from the sawmill, follow the gravel road into the swamp and up the hill. Nice trail, very susceptible to mud, goes to the top and hooks up with even more singletrack. The other newer trail is off the main road again on the left. It is right at the power lines and you turn left at the power lines and immediately left again onto the trail, look for tire tracks. Double back next to the road and then up the hill on really nice singletrack. There are many many many many trails here all designated for different uses. It is easy to be confused so grab a map and have fun exploring. Don't sweat the use designations too much, the management loves mountain bikers and if you have to get back you have to get back. check out bikeloft.com and the CNYDIRT page for group rides.

Members of the mountain bike organization approached Iredell County with a proposal to build the trail on County owned property, over the course of 3 years. The property is approximately 104 acres of wooded and open-space land with significant diversity in plant species. Most uniquely present is the Bigleaf Magnolia species, for which the park is named. Magnolia macrophylla, the Bigleaf Magnolia, is a deciduous magnolia native to the southeastern United States and eastern Mexico. This species boasts the largest simple leaf and single flower of any native plant in North America. Phase I of the facility features 2.5 miles of varying degrees in difficulty of mountain biking and hiking trails. Plans for additional trails are scheduled for fall and winter of 2016 and 2017, to extend the total trail mileage to approximately 6 miles. Since 2013, over 1500 hours of volunteer community efforts have been contributed to the property, including topography assessment, trail design, and finally trail construction. The development of this amazing new facility for Iredell County Parks and Recreation could not have been possible without the efforts of all of those dedicated volunteers",

The trail may change in the future when the previous issues get worked out.Mazeppa Park starts at the trail kiosk in the southeast corner of the main parking lot and travels north on Ridgeline Connector to begin the ride. After about 0.3 miles, the trail splits at the intersection with the GoPro Loop so take the right fork and continue on. After completing the loop, take a right back on Ridgeline Connector and enjoy the short downhill rhythm section as you make your way past the trail kiosk to the southern portion of the trail system. After the trail comes out of the woods, continue straight across the Greenway Loop and the access road and begin Mazeppa Tech. Once you reach the end of the trail at the second intersection with the Greenway Loop, you can do an out-and-back to the trail kiosk to conclude your ride or you can take a left on the Greenway Loop and complete a short loop that ends at the start of Ridgeline Connector.",

As far as construction, this has to be the most amazing trail you can find: bridges, crib walls, bench cuts, etc. As far as riding, it's not technical excpet for the occasional root cluster to bunny hop. There are some short climbs that seem to flow with the terrain that give you a short break. The downhill sections are wide and flow with the shape of the land. There are plenty of whoops to keep it exciting. This trail can be a challenge if you want to ride really fast; really makes you work on technique in corners, switchbacks.

Designed by Trail Dynamics, the trail has a minimal impact on the local ecosystem. In an effort to minimize erosion, the tread of the trail was constructed to allow surface water to flow evenly across the trail, following its natural course downhill. The Woodland Loop Trail complements the 100-acre park that marks the convergence of the Jacob Fork and Henry Fork rivers into the South Fork River.

Not for the newbie but a confident rider should attempt these obstacles with due respect of course.

The config for Horns Hill is a \"network\" because the climb back to the top is rather short, so you can keep networking trails together by riding the road back up. Of course many probably see this as a shuttle config.Warning this trails are not kid friendly, you need a full suspension and disk breaks. The biggest jump is 22 feet - it is a gap on trail with no sign.Trail 1 has a 6 foot Drop and a 10 foot Drop.

The park property is in two halves - the eastern half is the pedestrian loop and is a great park for hiking and jogging. The western half is bounded by Amanda Northern Road and Mason Road and the trail occupies nearly all of the property on this side. The trail is comprised of two loops that are to be ridden clockwise. From the parking lot, the trailhead is close to Mason Road and begins as a doubletrack grass path through a field. Once through the field, the trail narrows to singletrack and ducks into the woods. In the woods you will find a junction where the Moderate or More Difficult blue diamond trail climbs through a series of short switchbacks from 909 feet up to 1,352 feet. Once at elevation you will see an evident viewing area to see Columbus before entering the woods. On top of the ridge is a rock garden to navigate through. Eventually, this blue diamond trail descends and meets up again with the Easy green diamond trail near the junction for a great ride through the woods before descending and returning to the parking lot. The green trail is 4.5 miles and the blue trail adds 3.0 miles for a total ride of 7.5 miles as of the opening day of the trail. Another 2.5 mile loop is under construction on the land north of the green loop that, when completed, will bring the trail up to 10.0 miles.",

You will likely see a line of singletrack along the edge of the water. I would suggest starting in a clockwise direction otherwise you may not see the MTB trail markings if going counter-clockwise. Once you pass the boat dock, you will continue into the woods. There is one point where you will cross a wooden bridge, then up some steep stairs that you'll likely have to walk your bike up. At the top of the stairs, you can continue into the MTB trail to the left (careful, this section has the steepest section of MTB trail. Beginners may want to continue on the hiking path toward the campground). Once you hit the campground, the MTB trail is marked, and you will see orange paint on many trees alongside the trail. Follow the orange markings to continue on the trail, and you will make your way around Hargus lake.

    "description": "Only about 10 minutes from Fairborn and Dayton and Wright-Patterson AFB. There is enough parking for at least 30 vehicles. They now rent bikes on Saturday's in the summer months. Bathroom facilities were upgraded significantly with 2 permanent vault toilets/changing area, drinking fountain, and a bike wash station outside. The water is available seasonally April-October. Here is the official ,page https://www.metroparks.org/momba/ This park actually consists of several different trails from beginner to expert/advanced with various lengths ranging from about 1/2 miles to about 2 1/2 miles. There are over 9 miles of trails total and they may be ridden both ways. These are all mountain-bike only trails: no joggers, runners, hikers, or motor vehicles allowed. No pets allowed to be walked on trail either. Most of the trails are in the forest with lots of turns, twists, humps, and (mostly) minor climbs. The routes are EXTREMELY well marked and easy to follow. There is a trail guide at the beginning and at Five points Junction (where 5 of the trails cross) and Wild West Junction (usually a good turn around spot for beginner-intermediate riders) however, you will probably want to make sure to bring a printed trail guide. EMS points are also available if an accident should occur, but I did not see a phone or alarm so make sure to bring your cell phone (coverage should be decent - there is a cell tower not 2 miles away.) The low areas crossing small creeks have been pretty well laid with stones. The trails are mostly stone and rock free (just compacted dirt) except for the Advanced Trails: Hawk's Lair and The Talon. There is now a big difference in difficulty between the newly added beginner Tot Track just off the parking lot, beginner Hilltop Flow trail behind the restrooms, and Twisted, onto intermediate trails: Mr. ZigZap, Upper Stealth, Lower Stealth, and Creekside Trails. Hawk's Lair (Advanced) proved to be a huge jump in difficulty. Serious bikers would probably not have much trouble at all. The Talon is an advanced section in Hawk's, you cannot accidentally get to this section of trail. There are caution signs. All trails have turns with a few narrow spots between trees. There are great wooden bridges for the lower-swampy areas. You have to ride through some of the courses to reach others. Note: There is now a course for young children (tiny tots and teens that opened last year!). Overall, it is a very well done mountain bike only facility.

I prefer the Orange trail and the Blue is great for a longer, more technical ride. My only complaint is that the trails are shared with Equestrians, so there is one sections where the trails all come back together near the trailhead which is basically a dirt road through a prairie and if it's rained recently, the horse tracks will beat you to death.

    "description": "This trail follows the western side of the Deschutes River for the first 12.5 miles then crosses to the Sun River side. Heading south on this trail is traveling upstream on the river thus some elevation is gained, about 300 ft going this direction. This is a very well planned and built trail that runs through several park areas along the river that can be very busy with other users at times. Most all of these areas are accessed off of Road 41 and offer numerous starting points. Along the section between the Big Eddy Rec site and Dillon Falls (about 2.5 miles) there are a couple different routes all marked by different signage, there are also maps at all the kiosks along the way. Although the route nearest the river is always open to MTB through here it is encouraged to use the alternate MTB route during high use times- summer weekends, holidays, etc. The trail itself is a great singletrack that climbs and descends ridges as it follows the river. There is a little technical area within the first couple miles but after that it is a fantastic novice/intermediate ride through the woods. Scenery along the way is incredible, with many waterfalls, lava rock formations and wildlife to see. As you near Benham Falls there are a couple trails heading west away from the river, these climb up to Benham Butte and beyond. Following the river trail past Benham Falls brings you to a footbridge across the river and another 2.5 miles of great trail to Sun River. A left turn after the footbridge will lead along the Blackrock trail through the lava fields 4 miles to the Lava Lands Visitor Center on Highway 97.",

This is not a technical ride by any means,, it is just a great workout and quite a scenic tour. The trail is mostly rolling hills,, up and down,, few roots from trees to go over,, and lots of cinder and volcanic ash all over. Soft terrain.

    "description": "<b>Update 7/22/13 by mtbgreg1:</b>The Phil's Area Trail System is the go-to trail system for mountain biking in Bend. Even the other trails in the region that aren't actually part of the Phil's Trail System feed into or connect to trails that feed into Phil's. According to the locals, and for the purpose of our trail listings, the boundaries of the Phil's Area Trail System is a square comprised of Skyliners Road to the north, Highway 46 (Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway) to the south, Bend to the east, and the Storm King trail to the west.This complex trail system offers a variety of different trails, but on average the trails are very buff, very flowy, with some great corners to rail. The trail tread is quite loose and sandy, and gets very dry, especially late in the season, leading to \"moon dust\" conditions. Here and there you'll find some rock gardens, skinnies, and sections of flow trail with big jumps and massive berms! All of the difficult sections do feature ride arounds, making this an extremely beginner-friendly area.<b>Previous Listing:</b>This route goes along a popular trail close to town and is ideal for mountain biking. A lot of the roads and trail names are unmarked so watch for the Bike Route signposts. Mileposts: 0.0 - Phil's Trailhead. Head west down the wide cinder road FS road 4606. 0.2 - Turn left onto a closed road (Phil's Trail). 0.3 - Bear left at the fork in the road/trail (Kent's Trail) staying on Phil's Trail. 0.8 - Turn right onto FS road 030 (white pumice road). 1.4 - At a pumice pit the trail continues off to the left side. 1.5 - Head straight at the next trail junction with KGB Trail 2.2 - The trail tops out and crosses FS road 4610. 2.8 - At the fork in the trail (Kent's Trail) bear left, staying on Phil's Trail. 2.9 - (For a shorter option look for Voodoo Trail on the right that will connect you back to Ben's Trail.) 3.9 - Upon reaching a red cinder road (FS road 300) turn right. (for a longer option continue up Phil's Trail and coming down Woops Trail. ) 4.2 - Look for a trail on the right, take that trail and head down Ben's Trail. The trail winds and crosses the FS road 900 several times. 5.7 - Fade Left at the junction with the Voodoo Trail. 6.3 - Where the trail crosses FS road 4610 go right and then immediately left, fade left again and just after a few woop de doos look for the start of Ben's Trail on the right. 7.3 - Turn right staying on Ben's Trail. 7.4 - Fade left staying on Ben's Trail (MTB Trail on right). 7.9 - Join Kent's Trail and head back to the trailhead by turning left. 8.3 - Head straight at the junction with Phil's Trail and return to the trailhead. 9.0 - Return to trailhead.",

    "description": "This ride offers just about everything. Singletrack, doubletrack, old woods road, forest road, vistas, tough climbs, awsome descents, easy, intermediate, and advanced trails.Start from the trail head taking a Left on the road you drove in on. At the intersection with McCall Dam Rd turn Right up the hill. Climb the hill and begin the descent until you reach Black Gap Rd. Turn Left on Black Gap Road. Just after the parking lot on the Left make your first Left on the old woods road. This is McCall Field Rd. Continue on this trail and stay to the Right as McCall Field Tr heads to the Left. You will now be on Jamboree Trail. Follow Jamboree until you can make a Left onto Black Gap Trail. Follow Black Gap to Engle Rd and make a Left. At the intersection with Tunis Rd make a Right and ride until you come across Hough Mt Trail/Halls Trail on your Right. There are a few spurs off of this trail but it is pretty obvious which way to go. If you get dumped out on PA-880 you made a wrong turn. For the most part keep Right. Hough Mt meets up with Hall Trail and loops you back down to onto Engle Rd not for from where you came out from Black Gap Trail. Cross the brigde and gate at the cabin and turn Left on Engle Rd. Follow Engle Rd down over the hill passing straight thru the intersection. Look out for and take a Left on White Deer Creek Trail ( a rocky but very rideable trail, not the rockiest you will see either). Follow this trail across to McCall Dam State Park and make a Right on the road. Almost immediately take a Left onto White Deer Creek Rd. Make your first Left onto Green Hollow Road (I believe, either way its your first left) Climb the hill untill the elbow where you will make a Right onto Duncan Trail. Mostly flat, but bumpy, this trail will take you over to Cooper Mill Rd. You should be able to hear the traffic from I-80. Take a Right on Cooper Mill and head down the hill. At the elbow go left thru the gate onto Cowbell Hollow. Run Cowbell Hollow up and over the other side of the ridge making sure to ride carefully on the washed out drop of the mountain. You will pop out behind a white cabin. Go around the cabin, cross the bridge go around the gate. Make a Right on White Deer Creek Rd. Just down the road make a Left switchback turn onto Running Gap Rd. Climb the hill on this unmaintained forest road and have fun on the downhill on the other side. Running Gap spits you out at Spruce Run Road. Take a Right and climb until you reach the intersection with Cooper Mill Road and take a Left. Not to far up Cooper Mill turn Right onto the singletrack at the Old Tram Trail sign. This trail is labled on some maps as Buffalo Flat Tr and will connect you will Old Tram. This trail is rocky but fun. Follow the singletrack passing the intersection with the Mid-State Trail. Just past this intersection you will reach the intersection with Old Tram Trail, take the Right down the hill.(If rocky as hell isnt your thing keep heading straight past this intersection for a shorter and less rocky finish to Buffalo Flat that will put you out at Sand Mountain Road, take a Right and run it back to the trail head). But like a said take the right on Old Tram Trail and get ready for the rocks. Pedal thru them if you can you'll feel great when you make it. Old Tram comes to a T intersection with Boiling Spring Trail just beside a powerline. Take a Left and bomb down this nice little trail, stopping at the spring to your left if you wish, to just below the trail head at the beach. There, now you came to R.B. Winter and rode some of the best the surrounding trails have to offer. Don't you feel great? Take a dip in the lake, grill a hot dog, you deserve it. Oh and don't feel bad if you can't wipe that silly ear to ear grin off your face. ",

Rail trials, some singletrack, double track, beautiful scenery and the Penns View Vista where you can look down on the route you just took. There are some hike-a-bike sections as well. Although it is worth while to get to the vista.Start the ride at Cherry Run Road and head up and under the Rail bridge.Turn Left on Old Mingle Road and start the about 2 mile climb. Make sure you stay on Old Mingle and do not turn onto Lick Hollow Road.Once to the top of Old Mingle in descends to a dead end at Penns Creek. You shoule be able to see the single track to your right that heads down along the creek.Take this single track along Penns Creek, very rocky at spots you may have to walk some of it. Or all of it depending on your skill level.You will pa**ome old railroad abutments and soon after you will hope onto the road and go through Ingleby. Turn left onto the road (Just follow the creek)At this point you will get onto one of the rail trail sections and cross an old railroad bridge after which you will go through the Tunnel Mountain Tunnel. It is very rocky in the tunnel so be careful. When you get through the tunnel turn left and head toward Coburn. A little down the road stay to the right as the road forks.You will cross a green iron bridge into Coburn, turn left onto Georges Valley Road.Turn left at the fork and cross Penns Creek on a paved road that will merge with Millheim Pike.On this long climb you will pass a road to a camp site on your left and a little past that you will see a Bald Eagle State Forest sign on your right.On your left just after the telephone pole is a steep single track trail up over the side of the mountain. If you can ride it you are better man than me. It is a hike up that side but it will be worth it at Penns View Vista. Once to the top after passing a right hand spur trail turn left at the 4 way intersection on the ATV trail. Soon after that keep left as the trail forks.Turn right at the next 4 way intersection onto the old woods road. This last section can be rocky in spots.This will then put you out onto Poe Paddy Drive, Make a left on the road.Just down the road you will come across Penns View Vista on your left and it makes that last few miles of hell worth while.From this point head down the road and make a right at the marked trail. I forget the name but there is a dead end sign on the marker. The trail will pass a right hand spur trail and becomes narrow, you can follow the blue blazes. There is a singletrack that drops off the side of the mountain. At the end of this trail the blazes turn right but if you go straight you can cross Big Poe Creek and turn left onto Poe Valley Road.Go through Poe Paddy Recreation area across a wooden bridge and take a right onto the dirt road which turns into a wide singletrack and will cross over another railroad bridge over Penns Creek.You will then pass through Poe Paddy Tunnel, which will feel like is air conditioned in the summer.This starts the other rail trail section which you will continue on for a while until if looks over grown ahead and you can veer left at the gate onto the road.Merge onto the dirt road and follow it back to Cherry Run Road where you are parked.This ride starts at a different spot that in the book Mountain Biking Pennsylvania. But it is the same ride. It is nice to have the rail trail section with Poe Paddy Tunnel at the end. Instead of right away at the beginning.Poe Paddy Tunnel is smooth cinder with no rocks. However it is longer than the Tunnel Mountain Tunnel. You may want a small flashlight.",

Take a right to climb back out on Laurel Run Rd. just as you came in, possibly adding a trail from Little Flat Tower to add some fun.",

When you hit Broad Mountain Rd turn Right then left onto Kettle Rd. Just up the road Sass picks up again on your right. Sass is marked at both roads with a sign. Ride Sass up over Milligans Knob. Keep following Sass as it steeply drops off the face of the mountain. Cross over Baily Gap road onto Sass-xx and follow this sweet single track out to Cooper's Gap Rd. At Coopers Gap turn left up the hill and at the private road on the right take the single track on the right (Deer Tick Tr.). Follow this trail as it loops and winds its way through the woods. You will eventually end up at the top of the mountain on Beautiful Trail. At Conklin Rd go straight across to Chicken Peter Trail on the other side. Eventually this trail will come out just along Cooper's Gap rd. Stay on the single track straight ahead up over the little hill back into the woods. Stay straight at the connecter and follow the trail back out to Cooper's Gap Rd. Turn Left up Cooper's Gap. Turn Right on Kettle Rd and CLIMB. At the intersection with Broad Mountain Rd turn left and keep your eye out for the small single track on your left (Bigelow Trail). Follow Bigelow Trail as it loops right and turns into Pigpile Trail. Follow Pigpile passing by the B.R. &amp; S Trail down to Barrville Rd. Turn Right on Barrville and follow it down to PA-305. Take a right down the road and back to your ride at Greenwood Furnace. This ride can be modified any number of ways but this route is pretty solid with tons of fun single track and limited forest road. Check the map for the 2007 Stoopid 50 on the Nittany Mountain Bike Association website (even though this route differs a bit). www.nittanymba.org",

Monagas National Park and is composed of around 15 trails that run throughout the park. They are properly identified with signs marking the entry and exit points, and direction arrows throughout the routes. They are identified at their entry points with difficulty level logos which makes it easier for newcomers to know which trail to tackle first. The park is located in which as an US Army location, so throughout the park one can see old bunkers and watch posts. The trails are composed of single-tracks with lots of roots present throughout the trails. There are some streams of water that needs to be crossed though the wooden bridges in place, and some natural \"staircases\" formed by the large roots, which combined with the uphill location of the roots and the narrow of the track throw the technical part to the mix. The list of trails currently active on the network are: -La Caverna-Mirador-El Lago-Cuesta Las Marias-Las Tablas-Magic Kingdom I-Magic Kingdom II-Los Columpios-La Ceiba-Los Picapiedras-Boys Scouts-Triple Cuesta-Blair Witch -Hobbits-Almendros As previously mentioned, the trails are located inside a forest park, so rain in the months of October to February is normal in the area which can render some of the trails unusable. But hey, it's the Caribbean! So a couple of continuous days of sun and all trails are back. For more information about this location you can call the Park offices at (787) 269-6600 & (787) 269-6603.",

The North South trail runs through the area and is marked with blue blazes. Ignore all signs saying \"Hikers Only\", the entire area is open to MTBers.The recomended route is bit complicated, so a map is suggested. A good map of the area (titled \"Hiking Trails, Footpaths and Roads in Carolina and Burlingame Wildlife Management Areas\") can be purchased at the W.E. Stedman bikeshop in Wakefield. You can also pick up a free map at the Hunter Check station in the Great Swamp Management Area. The Carolina Management area is small enough to be explored in a single day, and makes for a good after work ride if you live in the area. This is a Wildlife Management area, so remember to wear your 200 square inches of day-glow orange during hunting season. ",

There is also a 5 mile loop of mostly doubletrack hills directly accessible on the north, in the Burlingame Management Area.The 8-mile Yellow Dot Trail/Vin Gormley Trail (also the King of Burlingame race loop) winds around Watchaug Pond. The trail is accessed by riding either north or west out of the parking lot for about a mile up the road. It is the standard loop that most local riders know, and it is a fast rolling loop with some short technical climbs and a few rock fields. While there are a good amount of roots showing, fast and smooth-rolling stretches dominate the scene. Info taken from RI Nemba site",

This location is the approximate middle section of the Greeneway which actually travels under the main entrance to the Riverview Park Activities Center. Adequate parking is available at both the Eastern Terminus and Riverview Park. Phase I of the Greeneway, 3.3 miles, runs from the Georgia Avenue Bridge to Martintown Road. Phase II, another 1.5 miles, extends the Greeneway to its current western terminus at Pisgah Road.Phase IV, completed in 2000, extended the Greeneway another 0.5 miles east from the Georgia Avenue Bridge to the Clubhouse at the RiverClub Golf Course. Construction is currently underway on an extension of the Greeneway into the North Augusta Riverfront. The 1.5 mile extension will fork off the existing trail near Crystal Lake, follow Crystal Creek through the woods to the Savannah River, meander along the riverbank to the Georgia Avenue Bridge, and then return to connect with the Greeneway tunnel at Riverside Boulevard.

If you stick to the canal, the ride can be a leisurely Saturday afternoon stroll with the family, an intense endurance-building workout or a shortcut to historic downtown Augusta. Be sure to check out what's going on at Riverwalk. There are often concerts or shows at the ampitheater, a large Christmas tree and festive decorations in the winter, and in the summer there is a large fountain of water in the center of Riverwalk to cool off in. You can also grab a bite to eat at one of the many restaurants, visit Fort Discovery or the Augusta Art Museum, and have a snowcone.",

The climb to Bald Knob is an excellent climb with switchbacks and some boulders, so testing your bike control and legs is moderate.

The trail begins with a fun, fast pace, low on intensity and difficulty level but increases as you warm up. The first two-thirds of the trail rank all easy-moderate, it's the final third that rocks! They call it the Trail of Tears and the Black Trail. There are some tough climbs and fast switchbacks. My friends and I usually warm up on the easy trails and double up on the Tears and the Black. And for all of you hardcore singletrack junkies (myself included), ride to the left along the creek and follow across the road and up the hill on the right to follow the most challenging sections backward. There is no better singletrack that I have found in the Nashville area yet and it's only 45 minutes or so from Nashville.",

    "description": "This 7,100 acre West Texas ranch has a network of 3 challenging loops that extend off of each other and encompass about 1,850 acres. The terrain is a mix of rocky limestone cedar hillsides, oak motts and mesquite flats. The maximum elevation drop on the ranch is about 150í so none of the climbs are very long. There are some short and rocky technical sections, but you have to stay focused as you consistently weave through the rocks on the hillsides and run off creek sections. Most of the trails are single track with a little double track mixed in. The middle ring single track on the hillsides is tight, twisty, and pretty rocky. There are some flat, semi smooth ridgeline sections mixed between the accents and descents to give you a breather. At the lower elevation of the ranch you enter the mesquite flats that are smooth and a little sandy. In here the single track opens up and you can pick up some speed. The short double track offers a good change of pace and you can work the big ring a little but there are no extended high-speed sections. From here you are back in the fun single track, across the flats again and a climb leads you back to the trailhead. At the trail head by the cabins there is a conveniently located pool over looking the valley where you can cool off after hammering out some miles. If you stay in the cabins, you can cook inside the lodge or BBQ outside. Camping is also available. Described by Rick Youman for MTB Central Texas guide book.",

Together, the parks have a collaboration of splash pads, swimming areas, climbing rocks, fishing docks, canoeing and kayaking, restrooms and multiple picnic and pavilion areas.

The City of Round Rock and Williamson County are currently working on the newest section of the east trail that will continue the regional trail west to A.W. Grimes Boulevard and connect to the Greater Lake Creek Trail System. With this addition, the total length of the Brushy Creek Regional Trail East will be 3.75 miles.

If you have the time and endurance, do the extra black loops, Upper and Reveille Peak, this is the Austin area's newest trail system just built by the Ridgeriders on a private ranch. Grand opening weekend is 12-13 February with race events. Trails open most weekends after that--when no race, the land access fee is 10$.The trail is very rocky and much is large granite rock face--trail in these sections are painted ala Moab style. Super grippy and fun.It is very tight in spots and is considered an advanced trail.There is some smooth dirt here and there.Don't leave your smart phone behind and do yourself a favor, download MTB Project or Trailforks in case you get lost.",

You can either follow the trail or cross the small stream and ride the dirt road - both will eventually connect to Ray's Valley Road. If you're a strong rider, take the trail (my preference). At the waterfalls, you'll have to carry your bike up a short rock face. At a trail intersection .5 miles above the waterfalls, turn to the right.At Ray's Valley Road, turn left onto the road and ride 4.5 to 5 miles to the Fifth Water Trail. (Look for a prominent double-track crossing the road on the far side of a creek, note the sign that says \"Fifth Water,\" and turn left downhill.) The first mile of Fifth Water is double-track. The next two miles of single-track have some tricky sections, then the trail widens and runs quickly down to Sixth Water (a larger creek), then to the Three Forks trailhead.

The downhill portion is smooth, fast and dotted with multiple washout jumps to catch plenty of air. There are even several large burms to carve on the way down. Have fun!!!!",

There is a gate you cannot drive past two miles from the top. It's about a five mile climb if you do it as a loop without shutting. Most of the trail is on top of the ridge line, several technical sections although everything is walkable if needed. After the ridge line you drop into the forest with wonderful swoops and dropping banked turns with many optional jumps. Then a short climb taking you to another ridge line for the final section of the trail. Well worth making the effort but likely not a good choice for beginners, having strong intermediate skills will be helpful. The trail is rated a Black Diamond and there are several sections (which are walkable) which make that rating correct but otherwise I'd call it a solid Blue run",

The Deer trail is the only trail that travels in the opposite direction, and forms its own loop. The majority of trails are easy to moderate. Only the Red Rock Trail would be considered difficult/ expert (and the only single track in the park). This is not to say that you will not experience short but steep climbs and descents along any of the trails. The provided trail map gives excellent detailed descriptions of each trail. The main parking area has a playground, picnic shelters, bathrooms and vending machines. A payphone is also available at the restrooms. Cell phone service is poor at best. The park indicates that it closes at sundown and ANY car in the park will be towed after closing! There are also several falls along the Tygret River that are accessible via walking/ riding trails near the main parking area.",

The map is invaluable and should be available at other locations. I'll check who the printer is and try to post info for locating one. There are a bunch of great trails on this map and some suggested rides that are great. To ride Props Run it's recommended to shuttle unless you like a 6 mile climb on Gravel Rd. and then a few more miles out the ridge. My favorite ride is to park one vehicle at Mine Rd. (FR24) just south of Slatyfork and use another vehicle and begin our ride at Gauley Mtn. Trail on Scenic Rt. 150. Ride Gauley Mtn Trial to Mine Rd., go left on mine road off Gauley Mtn. Trail, then stay right at all the remaining intersections. You will see the sign for props after a large stand of pines on top a hill and then going down a grade with a wide parking area on the right as the road levels. Look back to your right. Note a beautiful overlook of the valley when you pass Sharps Knob. For an extra view, go up the little double track on the left and get a couple more views from ontop the old strip mine area before continuing. Once you reach the Props Run trailhead, ride down Props, which comes out right at ERTC. Please just ride through their parking area and don't spend your money at their business, take a right on Rt.219 and ride about 1.2 miles to Mine Rd. and your vehicle. It's about 19 miles total. If you don't have a shuttle but want to ride this, we usually park at Mine Rd. parking area, ride up Mine Rd. past Gauley Mountain Trial and follow the directions above from that point. It's still about 20 miles that way. ",

    "description": "Take Gauley Mountain Trail off Mine Rd. and ride 1.5 miles, passing Tea Creek Connector Trail at .9 miles, and turning right on Bear Pen Ridge Trail. Take Bear Pen Ridge Trail for 3.5 miles to the bottom of the mountain. When you get to the bottom ride past Tea Creek Trail (one left and one right) and then cross Tea Creek (the stream). Continue on Bear Pen up the bank across the creek for another 1.7 miles to the intersection of Boundary Trail.Here you need to decide if you feel like another 2 miles of tough, technical riding with a few short tough climbs. If you decide to miss that challenge, a couple beautiful places on the trail and an awesome overlook, go straight past Boundary and continue about another 1/2 mile to FR135. In a few hundred feet you will come to a steep uphill into a strip mine clear cut. Ride down through the clear cut to FR135. WARNING there is a DEEP drainage ditch across the trail in these weeds making it easy to nose dive into. Be alert. Once at FR135 go right to vehicle if you didn't drive past this intersection at the beginning.To continue the modified, challenging and beautiful loop, take Boundary Trail, ride just over 1 mile to the top of the mountain and the next intersection. There are several signs there and the overlook is on your left. Note, Boundary Trail goes right when you arrive. Don't get confused when you leave and go down Turkey Point/Saddle Loop. After viewing the overlook and taking that much needed break continue down a fun 1/2 mile with a few switchbacks to a plateau that takes you through a tight laurel tunnel and then to a steep, 50 foot drop and hike-a-bike down it. Just a short distance you will come out on a Forest Road. Turn right, noting Bannock Shoals trail on your left. Follow this road to the next intersection and stay right on FR135 and at all major intersections till you reach your truck. About 17.5 miles total. What a blast ! Check out the pics of this trail for example.",

    "description": "Gauley Mountain Trail is used mostly as a connector trail for Right Fork Connector, Red Run, Bear Pen and Tea Creek Connector Trails. It is 5 miles from Rt.150 to Mine Rd. making it 10 miles out and back. It is also used to design loops including those other trails or add mileage to my favorite Props Run shuttle ride. This trail appears to have once been an old railroad grade, however is mostly singletrack now. There are a couple places where it resembles a doubletrack however those are few. There are a couple fairly steep, very rocky spots, several big mudholes (hopefully to be re-routed soon), some tight narrow laurel choked spots but all in all a good trail for beginners to learn on. Once you feel comfortable with this trail, the others will not be so overwhelming. I started my children on this trail years ago. Believe me, they loved getting all muddy. My son and I now include this as a start point to our Props Run Ride at least once or twice yearly. It is also used in the Bear Pen Loop and Modified Loop ride. Note: the trails in this area are \"Cross Country\" trails and should not be misconstrued with smooth, sculpted singletrack like you find in many parks. It is usually slow going except in a few spots where you can let it go and fly, like on Bear Pen Ridge, Tea Creek Mountain, and a few other places. You can get some good speed on Gauley Mountain Trail on the way back from Mine Rd.",

Ride north on Rt.7 for about a couple miles, go past Sheets Run Rd. and take the next road to the left. This is a narrow blacktop road that will climb for a mile or so and take you to Rt.260. Go left on 260 for another couple miles and watch for the trail signs on your left near the community of Yellow House. If you come to Co. Rd. 9 you passed it. Go left onto Ohio View Trail following it, across one gravel road in a few miles. Continue till you come out in the parking area you started at. There are some nice views along the way. One is a spur on your left that climbs a short climb to an overlook. See pic. There are a few steep climbs on this trail however there are some great downhill rewards as well. The first one off Rt.260 is awesome and fast. Be carefull when you reach the steep part there is a fairly tight turn near the bottom and then you shoot across a stream to begin a climb. About 2 miles into the trail you will come to a connector trail that goes hard up a very steep climb on your right. Do not go right, stay on the trail and you will cross Sheets Run Rd. The trail continues on the other side of the road at the three way intersection. At this time the trail goes out a logging road on the left, watch for the trail diamonds (markers). I hope to post some better pictures as soon as the trail opens in April. Note, this trail is like others in the Wayne National Forest. You must obtain a permit to ride. It is easiest if you get a yearly permit and the trails open in April. When you get your permit from the Forest Office in Reno Ohio, just north of Marietta across from the Highway Patrol Station.",

You will see Lake Trail go to the left about 3/4 the way up the hill. Take Lake Trail to the left, in about 3/4 mile you will pass Jungle Pass on your right, stay straight on Lake Trail. In a few miles you will pass an old cemetary on your left, the trail will go left in about 100 feet. Follow to the next intersection where the trail goes left downhill for 1/4 mile. When you come out in a bottom, stay left and cross an old broken up concrete bridge to the gravel road and go left again. Ride for about 1/4 mile and as you top a short climb watch on your right for Charlies Challege to climb up a steep bank and then start a grueling climb for another 1/4 mile. When you come to an intersection, Charlies Challenge goes to the right if you wish to use that route. However, I suggest going straight through onto Trevor's Trail. This trail will take you over \"The Whale Tail\" a fun section of trail. Follow past the first intersection staying straight (left) back onto Charlies Challenge till the 2nd intersection and go straight thru staying on Charlies Challenge. You will pass some big awesome rocks (Big Rocks) and you can play around on a couple that you can ride over. This trail gets awesome fast just before the end of it. Be carefull after about 1/4 to 1/2 mile of fast singletrack because a sharp left hand turn comes up quickly. It will be kinda steep down and then are hard right will dump you right out onto the dam. If you feel like you want more, after crossing the dam go back up the same climb from the parking lot, however this time you can keep climbing on the fire road or use Lake Trail. When you get all the way around the lake again, take Charlies Challenge to the right instead of Trevor's, then take Low Gap Trail and tie into (cross Charlies Challenge) at the next intersection and go onto Chadway (very fun, narrow trail) which comes out at that last sharp turn on Charlies at the dam. Go to Charles Fork Lake - Spencer WV and get the map from their website. It will be useful in deciding your loops. There is also a WVMBA series race held here near the 3rd week of May every year so be careful when you schedule your trip. It is always best to ride here a couple weeks before the race or a couple week after since the briers and spider webs are very bad. Some fun obsticles here as well.

Believe me it is worth the climb.After the tough climb you will be rewarded with some awesome singletrack that flows up and down the ridge out to Co.Rd.9. You can turn around there and ride back for a 7 miles quick evening ride, or cross Co.Rd.9 and continue on the NCT connector for another 3.5 miles till the connect with Archers Fork Loop / NCT. Turn around there and ride back for a 14 + mile out and back. Be careful on the decent down that steep switchback laden hill overlooking the mighty Ohio River.There are a few slightly technical places on this trail but lots of flowing singletrack you can fly on. What a great trail for beginners. If you are a beginner I would suggest getting the directions to the County Rd. 9 parking and ride out to the steep hill (with switchbacks) and just turn around there and ride back. No real difficult climbs or techy switchbacks to deal with. If you really feel froggy, you can begin at Leith Run, ride across Co.Rd.9 on the connector, turn right when you hit Archers Fork Loop and ride it counter clockwise till you come back to the connect (lollipop style) and then back connector and Scenic River Trail for about a 24 mile killer ride because Archers Fork Loop is up and down, and up, and down, and up and down all the way around.

Ride up Rt.150 and take Gauley Mtn. Trail, ride it 3.1 miles to Red Run Trail. Go left on Red Run (really tough trail). Just after hard left switchback you will hit Right Fork trail. Go straight (actually left) on Right Fork and start you climb back to the Tea Creek Mountain Trail. There is a gps file here on singletracks for this ride.

Campgrounds are open May through Sept. The trails are all on a peninsula in the Big Eau Pleine Flowage so when the water is high, the sections furthest from the main road can be quite wet and muddy. Trails closest to the Road: Popcorn, Hanna, Rock Garden, Dharma (Westside) remain relatively dry year round. All singletrack is of the older school rake &amp; ride variety. Roots, rocks and undulating terrain are commonplace. If you like old school gnar there is some of that as well. Park at the Winter/Horse parking lot across from the Ranger Station A-Frame about 3/4 mile in to the Park. The lot is shared with Equestrian folks but we maintain a very friendly relationship. Remember to yield to horses when riding; stop and greet. Horses are limited to the gravel doubletrack trails so be cautious when riding those trails. Start by the Outhouse to ride the technical Rock Gardens or start down the Horsetrail to Popcorn loop. The trails are not yet marked very well but will be beginning fall 2015 and spring/summer 2016. That said, it is hard to get too lost on a peninsula. Just make your way to the blacktop road that runs through the middle of the park. As of October 2015, there are over 9 total miles of singletrack. Several areas have just been rerouted and should have definition by Autumn. There is also a 9 mile gravel trail that runs through the park. You can mix them together for a fun 13-18 mile ride. When the flowage is low fat bikers can enjoy beach riding (sandy to rocky) the perimeter of the peninsula. The climbs are minimal but can be challenging during Winter.",

    "description": "A combination of Mountain Biking singletrack/snowshoe and XC ski trails. This trail has a little bit of everything with 18.3 miles of wide open XC-ski two track that can be dirt road hammer fests or just a nice easy green trail for beginners. The 13.5 mile single track system was heavily updated in 2014/2015 by the local IMBA Chapter, CWOCC. All single track is now interconnected with the trailhead near the south (front) end of the chalet where you can find The Pines or Jim's Trail. The single track system broken down into three loop clusters: the East Loops, across Red Bud Road, are some of the oldest trail. Hand built and generally rooty and rugged at times but also flow well. Yin/Yang loop is a good intermediate trail with Stone Soup being quite rocky and rugged advanced trail. The West Loop is a mix of new school/old school trail. All intermediate level trail the newest sections of Up Nort, Outbound and a chunk of Chainsmoker feature lots of berms and rollers for great flow. Root Canal, Icky Thump, half of Chainsmoker maintain the older hand built feel. The South Loop or advanced loop is accessed off the west end of Outbound. Here you'll be treated to a lot of rooty and rocky trail. The most challenging sections being Flower, Stinger, Ho Chi Minh, K-bypass and White Knuckle, however, there is one touch of bermed flowy goodness on the descent of Ho Chi Minh. This loop rides well in the counter clockwise direction starting with Flower and ending with White Knuckle. All trails are two way so there are lots of options for riding.Nine Mile County Forest is located only about 5 miles from the city of Wausau. The trail costs $4.00 to ride and $25.00 for an annual pass. All trail fees are allocated back towards the operation of Nine Mile recreation. The trails are open for riding from May 1st (conditions dependent) until October 15th. Also be aware that Nine Mile is a managed forest unit, hunting occurs early and late in the season and there are often logging operations that could affect trail access.",

Very well designed with a couple relatively nice climbs (for the flat landscape in North East Wisconsin), a good controlled descent with whoops and small jumps, a section of technical switchbacks and some nice flowy singletrack in between. The trail rides very well, fast and smooth with only a few rocky sections. Drys really nicely after a rain due to it being constructed on a hillside. Ride the trails clockwise on even days and counter clockwise on odd. It is much faster on the odd days but a better workout on the even. The trail is open to hikers and runners as well so watch out on some of the corners. There are running trails that cross the singletrack which aren't always obvious as you're bombing down the trail. Also, during the College's fall mountain bike season, the trail is closed to public use from approximately 4 to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday (and as posted) to allow the Red Hawks cycling team to train.",

    "description": "The Underdown is a gem of a trail system that has extensively changed from a handful of years ago. If you are looking for a rugged back country style ride with lots of technical singletrack with very little doubletrack networking, this is for you. There are now two trail heads, the main north trail head located off of Copper Lake Road northeast from the City of Merrill, nearest to Lincoln Hills correctional facility. Straight out of the north parking lot into the woods you hit singletrack that combines climbing with equal length downhill shots. For some 1x1 riders you might find yourself walking most of the climbs if you're not ready for them. Be prepared for some loose rocks, off camber runs with switchbacks, wet root sections and sweet downhills. There are also a number of nice bridges, boardwalk features along the trail. I've found that the knobbier the tire, the better. Updates in 2017 have brought a bit of machine built reconstruction to some of the interior trails to add a bit of flavor to the entire system.The second southern trail head is off of County Hwy R/Heineman Road in the City of Merrill Memorial Forest. The trail head at this time is nothing more than a grassy parking area and has NO drinking water or restrooms so be prepared. Head south around the metal gate for about 1/4 mile and you will access the Prairie Dells loop. A fun, easy 5 mile loop that highlights itself at the Prairie River Dells overlook about halfway through the loop. This trail is primarily machine constructed single track with a touch of double track. Plenty of climbing but not as severe as the northern Underdown area and all of the climbs are rewarded with fast, flowing downhills and berms.Heading north from the Prairie Dells trail head you can link up to the Underdown trails via the Connector trail, another machine built gem with lots of good flow, berms and some jumps. Access the connector trail from a double track entrance on the north side of the road right where the County Hwy R pavement ends into gravel road. Scoot around a cable gate and the single track shoots up the first ridge. Heading north for the next 2.3 miles you will primarily climb with a few short downhill rewards. But after you have ridden some loops on the Underdown interior head back down the connector for some really fun longer downhills with only short uphill sections.For a big day in the saddle combine the main outer perimeter of the Underdown with the Prairie Dells loop and you have about 30 miles of riding.Overall the singletrack trail system is perfectly maintained (even in the fall) and is marked very well.

From the 230a/341 junction head North riding 230 to the top of the mountain. Couple of fun technical challenges along this leg of the loop. Once you get to the top of the trail 230 will start to head West. From this point down to the 230/365 junction it's a rocky downhill. The big payoff! Once you get to the 230/365 junction head South on 365 to meet back up with 230a and finish off the loop. ",

Turn right onto the trail and go about 600 ft to where the trail forks and turn right onto trail 05543.

If you take the left fork up 05620, you can reach Forest Road 462 and the Coyote Trailhead. To continue up Chamisoso Canyon, take the right fork where the trail turns into a doubletrack and proceed a little over a mile. There will be a sign for 05184 to the left where the singletrack picks up again. Go another &#65533; mi. through a couple wide switchbacks until you come to a T-intersection with a sign for Mighty Mule pointing to the left. Turn right and keep going until you hit another trail (aprox. &#65533; mi.). This is where Chamisoso Trail ends. Turn left onto Delberts Trail (Trail 05622). This is the only part of the trail where I did not see a sign. Travel another 1.2 miles till you hit Forest Road 13 and turn left until you hit Forest Road 462.",

If you ride all the way to the top, beware of federal property. Even though higher in altitude, the ridges may melt out sooner than the canyon because they are exposed while the canyon gets less sun. The ridg on the right is very rocky and not always fun--it makes a better descent than climb. Otero Canyon proper is good either way.
