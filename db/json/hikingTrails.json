    "description": "Monagas Mountain Bike Trails are located at the municipality of Bayamon, which is inside Puerto Rico's metropolitan area. The trail network is inside the Julio E. Monagas National Park and is composed of around 15 trails that run throughout the park. They are properly identified with signs marking the entry and exit points, and direction arrows throughout the routes. <br /><br />They are identified at their entry points with difficulty level logos which makes it easier for newcomers to know which trail to tackle first. The park is located in which as an US Army location, so throughout the park one can see old bunkers and watch posts. <br /><br />The trails are composed of single-tracks with lots of roots present throughout the trails. There are some streams of water that needs to be crossed though the wooden bridges in place, and some natural &quot;staircases&quot; formed by the large roots, which combined with the uphill location of the roots and the narrow of the track throw the technical part to the mix. The list of trails currently active on the network are: <br />-La Caverna<br />-Mirador<br />-El Lago<br />-Cuesta Las Marias<br />-Las Tablas<br />-Magic Kingdom I<br />-Magic Kingdom II<br />-Los Columpios<br />-La Ceiba<br />-Los Picapiedras<br />-Boys Scouts<br />-Triple Cuesta<br />-Blair Witch <br />-Hobbits<br />-Almendros <br /><br />As previously mentioned, the trails are located inside a forest park, so rain in the months of October to February is normal in the area which can render some of the trails unusable. But hey, it's the Caribbean! So a couple of continuous days of sun and all trails are back. For more information about this location you can call the Park offices at (787) 269-6600 &amp; (787) 269-6603.",

The Visitor Center displays artifacts from the ranching and farming history of the Hayward area. There is a blacksmith shop, a tool shop and several ranching-related displays to explore. An interesting collection of antique farm machinery outside the barn augments the display. Meyers Cottage was a popular summer home of Edith, Mildred, and Jeanette Meyers, three sisters of Alameda who were very involved in local charities and fundraisers during the early and mid 1900s. The sisters also owned the 1,200-acre Dry Creek Ranch, which was donated to the Park District in 1979 and later opened as Dry Creek Regional Park. Upon the passing of the last surviving Meyers sister, the Meyers Cottage and its garden was also donated to the Park District. The Park District plans to eventually open the cottage for receptions, weddings, and similar events, and it will also house a small visitor center.",

The best part of this trail is the fast hardpack gravel/rip-rap trail surface with some large, well-constructed, downhill berms.<br />The trail can be divided into 4 sections (for the purpose of referring to its parts). Section one begins at the top of the hill, includes 4 berms on a quick downhill switchback and exits on to the park service road. <br />From there you ride up the service road about 50+ feet to the beginning of section 2, which heads off into the woods down to the left includes a benched downhill trail with 2 berms and a culvert crossing. This section exits into singletrack crossing a small grassy field. <br />Travel straight into the field 100-150 ft and enter section 3 into the woods to the right.

You can easily park your car there and ride into the park, getting access to the trails for free!<br /><br />While at first the trails appeared to be just wide, gated gravel roads, as I continued around the park I started to find more and more singletrack. The trails were entertainingly rocky in places, and uber fast and smooth in others. <br /><br />Despite having a trail map, I had issues following the designated route in places. As I was nearing the end of the loop, I took a wrong turn and ended up on a different trail that took me out of the park. It conveniently led me very near to where I had parked at the park and ride, so in the end everything worked out!<br /><br />One word of caution: these trails are very exposed, and the majority of it has absolutely no shade or respite from the blazing sun.
